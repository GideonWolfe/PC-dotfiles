2019-02-03 13:11:42	thunor	hi
2019-02-03 13:11:49	thunor	how do you simulate logging off on linux?
2019-02-03 13:11:51	barteks2x	I spend good 10 minutes wondering why the data makes absolutely no sense
2019-02-03 13:11:58	thunor	i want all the effects of logging off without logging off
2019-02-03 13:12:11	thunor	because it fixes a bug in a program

2019-02-03 13:13:10	MrElendig	no it doesn't
2019-02-03 13:13:18	MrElendig	at best it is a horrible workaround
2019-02-03 13:13:20	barteks2x	actually... it shows indicuual bytes in the wrong order
2019-02-03 13:13:24	MrElendig	it is not an actual fix
2019-02-03 13:13:25	barteks2x	but that's assuming 2 byte chunks...
2019-02-03 13:13:27	koollman	thunor: which program ? how would that fix a big ?
2019-02-03 13:13:30	koollman	*bug
2019-02-03 13:13:48	MrElendig	a fix would prevent the issue from happening in the first place.....
2019-02-03 13:13:52	thunor	koollman, minecraft, something to do with pixmap error or it doesn't run at all
2019-02-03 13:14:07	koollman	thunor: maybe read the error messages, then
2019-02-03 13:14:15	 <<< 	vuoto (~vuoto@customer-212-237-101-103.ip4.gigabit.dk) has quit (Client Quit)
2019-02-03 13:14:15	barteks2x	how logging can have anything to do with minecraft?
2019-02-03 13:14:19	barteks2x	there is no way that's true
2019-02-03 13:14:24	 <<< 	Karyon (~karyon@unaffiliated/karyon) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2019-02-03 13:14:32	thunor	logging off
2019-02-03 13:14:40	loeken	if you logg of you close the program :p
2019-02-03 13:14:51	loeken	so maybe that's how he "solves" the problem
2019-02-03 13:15:17	TJ-	barteks2x: sounds like you're describing the difference between big- and little- endian words
2019-02-03 13:15:33	barteks2x	I would expect a hexdump to show the bytes exactly as they are...

2019-02-03 13:19:08	barteks2x	that looks like a GPU driver issue to me. Or maybe a bad mod, if it's modded
2019-02-03 13:19:17	thunor	what are you talking about? LOGGING OFF fixes the issue
2019-02-03 13:19:24	TJ-	barteks2x: are you sure xxd (by default) isn't displaying big-endian ? see its "-e" switch
