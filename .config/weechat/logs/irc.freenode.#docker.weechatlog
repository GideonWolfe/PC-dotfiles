2019-05-21 14:48:37	_Raijin	I am converting a docker-compose application to use docker-swarm. Since swarm doesn't build images on the fly, I need to reference a pre built image. I know that using a local registry is a viable option, but is there any wau to point swarm at local images built with docker-compose <service name>?
2019-05-21 14:49:30	_Raijin	correction for the last command: docker-compose build <service name>

2019-05-21 14:56:55	iffraff	Hello, I'm have a new gig, and they have a rails app and some react frontend stuff.  I am trying to dockerize it.  Currently they are hitting the rails server which serves a page that then has calls to the webpack dev server.  This works fine when all the code is sitting on your machine, but in separate containers, I can't seem to access the webpack dev server code

2019-05-21 14:58:20	iffraff	so i have rails on :3000 and webpack on :8989 I hit 3000 from my browser which returns a page that then calls to :8989 to get the bundle.  Frankly not sure why this would work locally bun not in containers
2019-05-21 15:01:35	iffraff	In fact it seems I can't seem to hit the server from the browser event on it's own. which is strange

2019-05-21 15:09:25	zoredache	Do you have a custom network setup so you can use the service discovery and the rails can reference the other service by name?
2019-05-21 15:10:27	iffraff	zoredache: so, I'm using docker-compose which I beleive sets up the network for me.  and yes I can use the service name as an alias, but I DON"T really know how to do that in ruby.
2019-05-21 15:11:26	iffraff	but what's int3eresting is that when I run the webserver locally and in the browser type localhost:8989/blah  I get data.  but when I start up the container and try I can't react it.
2019-05-21 15:11:42	zoredache	Assuming you have everything setup correctly, you should access it the same way you access any dns name.  like google is http://www.google.com.  Your internal service might be http://container_name:port/path ...
2019-05-21 15:12:39	zoredache	you can't use 'localhost' when they are in different containers, since localhost is separate.
2019-05-21 15:13:05	zoredache	well it is unless you link the network namespace anyway.

2019-05-21 15:17:18	zoredache	depends on what ports you publish, also depends on if you are using a proxy like traefik or something
2019-05-21 15:17:34	zoredache	if you published 8989, then you used 8989 though.
2019-05-21 15:19:07	iffraff	crap. so when I look in dev tools network, what I see is http://frontend:8989/blah and faild  so I would have thought it would have changed the work frontend out

2019-05-21 15:20:38	iffraff	which container?
2019-05-21 15:20:54	zoredache	not the container, the system hosting your containers.
2019-05-21 15:21:18	zoredache	are you running these in a cloud?  In a local VM, or what?
2019-05-21 15:21:40	iffraff	hmmm, not sure I mean I would think it;s 127.0.0.1 right?  oh no sorry I'm just doing this on my dev box for now ( local laptop )
2019-05-21 15:22:20	cim2095	default should start with 172.0.x.x
2019-05-21 15:22:33	cim2095	default subnets*
2019-05-21 15:22:56	zoredache	iffraff: ok, but is your 'devbox' linux/windows/osx? They all do things a bit differently for the setup.
2019-05-21 15:23:49	iffraff	I'm really starting to think this is a bout the webpack dev server container.  I should be able ( from my desktop )  to hit localhost:8989/blah and have that hit my dev server in that box.  That's how I do it at home.  I'm running ubuntu, here and at home
2019-05-21 15:25:03	zoredache	ok, if native linux, then localhost may work.  If you do a docker container ls, do you see your containers?  Are they active, and is port 8989 published?
2019-05-21 15:26:08	iffraff	yes and if I exec into my devserver container and curl the :8989 I get a response
2019-05-21 15:26:16	iffraff	but from the outside I do not.

2019-05-21 15:28:32	iffraff	zoredache: yes  0.0.0.0:8989->8989/tcp
2019-05-21 15:28:43	iffraff	which is strange cuz the otherones are  127.0.0.1
2019-05-21 15:29:06	iffraff	I can paste my docker-compose for that service if you like?
2019-05-21 15:29:14	cim2095	yeah that should've been exposed to the outside world
2019-05-21 15:29:23	cim2095	unless you got a firewall
2019-05-21 15:29:32	iffraff	does the 0.0.0.0 mean it's not exposed?
2019-05-21 15:29:57	cim2095	that's just docker's version of localhost i think
2019-05-21 15:30:22	iffraff	oh, right, so you are saying I should be able to hit that container.  I agree. I'm not sure why I can't
2019-05-21 15:30:38	zoredache	0.0.0.0 is basically a wild card IP. It means that is bound to any externally visible IP address on the system at port 8989
2019-05-21 15:31:04	iffraff	I mean I just have the dockerfile, volumnes, command and ports
2019-05-21 15:31:25	iffraff	I wonder if webpack dev server is doing something strange but I don't see how
2019-05-21 15:31:26	zoredache	so figure out the actual ip of your system, perhaps eth0 or whatever and try doing a curl http://publicip:8989
2019-05-21 15:31:51	cim2095	what kind of server is running int he container?

2019-05-21 15:32:24	iffraff	it's webpack devserver.  it's basically a node server
2019-05-21 15:32:32	cim2095	so default should be 3k
2019-05-21 15:32:36	cim2095	ip:3000

2019-05-21 15:39:51	@ada	I don't have the earlier bits of conversation in my scrollback
2019-05-21 15:39:55	iffraff	so, netstat returned a line with 127.0.0.1:8989
2019-05-21 15:40:07	@ada	your server is listening for connections from loopback ONLY
2019-05-21 15:40:19	@ada	so connections from your host OS are traversing this virtual interface and get dropped
2019-05-21 15:40:26	@ada	that should be 0.0.0.0:8989 inside the container
2019-05-21 15:40:28	iffraff	I wonder if there is a command that I can use to ping the container, but not the webserver?  I mean to isolate it so I know it's not the webserver that's fubar
2019-05-21 15:40:33	@ada	no
2019-05-21 15:40:35	@ada	because ping is icmp
2019-05-21 15:40:42	@ada	a container doesn't respond to icmp'=
2019-05-21 15:40:59	@ada	the network interface does
2019-05-21 15:41:01	iffraff	here's the full ouput

2019-05-21 15:41:06	@ada	you are bound to loopback
2019-05-21 15:41:09	@ada	thats the problem
2019-05-21 15:41:17	@ada	that should be 0.0.0.0:8989 and not 127.0.0.1
2019-05-21 15:41:26	@ada	so the application will only respond to connections initiated from inside the container

It works with swarm configs/secrets, but those are mounted from the host filesystem they use custom interfaces. Can I do anything from my local machine or do I need to copy files over to the host?

2019-05-21 17:30:31	rubidious	Am I correct that an ARG declaration in a dockerfile will break layer caching? IE. If you send build args to docker build, that it cannot reuse any layers AFTER the ARG declaration?
2019-05-21 17:30:45	rubidious	or is it just if the value of the build arg changes?

2019-05-21 17:32:23	rubidious	if the former is true, doesn't that sort of kill the usefulness of ARG? I could understand if the layer had to be rebuilt if the ARG value changed, but if it doesn't matter if it changed or not that sort of breaks its entire usefulness

2019-05-22 07:21:07	@programmerq	other than that, you'd have to run some sort of API proxy that would sit between your user and docker and add in limits to the container create requests.

2019-05-22 07:23:35	@programmerq	but it would just be a much better interface to have "if you don't specify, then you get limit xyz instead of unlimited"

2019-05-22 10:42:48	choice	Syllin: You mean if apache inside docker listens on port 80, then accessing 127.0.0.1:80 on the host will access the apache inside the container?
2019-05-22 10:43:26	Syllin	not necessarily. in that example, you would publish port 80. by default the publish would try to bind to port 80 on the host machine, but you can configure that. you may need to, if you dont have root on the host machine
2019-05-22 10:43:27	Syllin	for example..
2019-05-22 10:43:53	Syllin	docker run -p 8080:80 your_thing should map localhost:8080 to inside the container:80
2019-05-22 10:43:54	choice	If it worked like that, all would be fine.
2019-05-22 10:44:10	choice	Let me try...
2019-05-22 10:44:27	choice	What is the --hostname parameter you can add to docker run?
2019-05-22 10:44:35	Syllin	hm not sure :)
2019-05-22 10:44:53	choice	Apache is still installing. I wonder if it is slower to install it inside docker then on the host. It takes quite long.
2019-05-22 10:45:22	Syllin	looks like --hostname is for the container, so if you run `hostname` in the container it'll show whateve ryou specified. could be needed for configuring your network
2019-05-22 10:45:46	Syllin	typically you'd want the apache install to be cached. its possible your dockerfile is written such that you have a cache miss every time
2019-05-22 10:45:56	choice	cached?
2019-05-22 10:46:28	Syllin	yeah, docker images are layered, so if you have a 20 line Dockerfile and change only the last line, you start from line 19's result last run
2019-05-22 10:46:50	choice	I dont have a dockerfile.
2019-05-22 10:46:56	Syllin	ah
2019-05-22 10:47:08	Syllin	then after you pull the image once it should be fast eveyr time after

2019-05-22 10:47:40	Syllin	i guess the dockerfile does the install at runtime then
2019-05-22 10:47:49	Syllin	would be faster if it did at build time

2019-05-22 10:48:18	choice	But that is fast.
2019-05-22 10:48:29	choice	"apt install php" inside the container is slow.

2019-05-22 12:13:53	electricbear	hi, can someone explain why a file would not be found from a "command: -command-" in docker-compose, yet if I sh into the container it is all there and can be ran with the command?
2019-05-22 12:13:55	cim209	just remember, those mods you do in the script is only temporary in the container

2019-05-22 12:14:45	@ada	choice: typically we don't commit images;  I never ever recommend using "commit" it should honestly be harder to use to dissuade it
2019-05-22 12:14:56	@ada	the typical build starts with a Dockerfile that defines what's in your image
2019-05-22 12:15:09	@ada	you'd start from a clean base like ubuntu or debian and install what's necessary via RUN commands in your dockerfile
2019-05-22 12:15:18	cim209	or alpine
2019-05-22 12:15:21	@ada	and you'd use the CMD/ENTRYPOINT instructions to set the "process" that will be running in your image
2019-05-22 12:15:32	@ada	or you could use the well-made library/ images like the official apache image
2019-05-22 12:15:34	choice	ada: I prefer to have a shellscript that does a bunch of things. Building the image being one of them. And not needing additional files.

2019-05-22 12:16:23	cim209	if you do all your mods in an entrypoint script then it'll just delay the start up process of a service
2019-05-22 12:16:48	choice	cim209: Not the mods. Just *starting* apache
2019-05-22 12:17:01	@ada	the mechanism to start your container's process is CMD/ENTRYPOINT
2019-05-22 12:17:08	@ada	thats not going to change because yo uwant to do it a different way

2019-05-22 12:17:18	tang^	I think the idea is run the shell script (to duplicate Dockerfile and `docker build` functionality) to set everything up and then `docker commit` to save that to an image
2019-05-22 12:17:25	cim209	cause they already have the script to auto start it

2019-05-22 12:29:10	Isom	I'm having some issues with mounted volume permissions: on my mac, I have a mounted volume and am able to modify it from inside (and outside) a docker container. But when I use the same docker container on a Linux server (Ubuntu 18.04), I suddenly don't have permissions to modify files. (I can still read them)
2019-05-22 12:29:12	Isom	any ideas?
2019-05-22 12:29:49	Isom	just as a simple test case I'm entering the container with bash and running touch test.txt
2019-05-22 12:31:02	@ada	Isom: on a mac, because the docker engine lives in a vm, we can do some userspace magic with sharing your local volumes into it - it offloads the file portion to the vm's file sharing mechanism
2019-05-22 12:31:07	@ada	so we can abstract that away from the user
2019-05-22 12:31:14	cim209	electricbear: i just did a docker run test
2019-05-22 12:31:26	@ada	with engine on linux, you are just dealing with a single linux filesystem, so you have to take into account the file's ownership & mode
2019-05-22 12:31:48	@ada	Isom: tl;dr use "ls -ln" from both inside and outside the container to look at the file's owner's numeric uid
2019-05-22 12:31:52	cim209	there's no entrypoint so the image just executes python3, that's why your commands don't work

2019-05-22 12:32:05	@ada	Isom: the bottom line is the UID of the container user would need to match the UID of the file's owner on your host filesystem
2019-05-22 12:32:14	electricbear	cim209 can you clarify what an entrypoint is?
2019-05-22 12:32:33	@ada	electricbear: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/docker-entrypoint-cmd-dockerfile-best-practices-abc591c30e21
2019-05-22 12:32:33	cim209	entrypoint is what the container will execute on container up
2019-05-22 12:32:46	@ada	https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#entrypoint
2019-05-22 12:32:53	@ada	CMD and ENTRYPOINT are both evaluated if they are set
2019-05-22 12:32:57	@ada	or you can use one or the other
2019-05-22 12:33:02	cim209	ya
2019-05-22 12:33:03	@ada	the semantics are slightly different
2019-05-22 12:33:05	cim209	so the python image only has CMD
2019-05-22 12:33:14	cim209	which is executing python3 directly
2019-05-22 12:33:27	electricbear	so how would I resolve this?
2019-05-22 12:33:39	electricbear	quotes? lol
2019-05-22 12:33:44	cim209	you can override the entrypoint with your own
2019-05-22 12:33:54	cim209	or rebuild the image with your mods
2019-05-22 12:33:56	@ada	in your own Dockerfile, you could set your own CMD & ENTRYPOINT
2019-05-22 12:34:08	@ada	or build the original w/ your changes like cim209  said
2019-05-22 12:34:31	electricbear	so I can just do a new Dockerfile with FROM and then the entrypoint code?
2019-05-22 12:34:52	@ada	that could work

2019-05-22 12:45:44	@ada	for example, if you're running nginx as non-root, it won't be able to bind low ports, so no binding to 80 _inside the container_  because you have to be root to bind a low port
2019-05-22 12:45:56	Isom	sure

2019-05-22 14:30:20	@ada	this is what the entrypoint is good for - you can set up your execution environment and then `exec ` your process so that it becomes the new PID1 and the container lifecycle works correctly

2019-05-22 20:42:29	krainboltgreene	Is there a way to ignore layer caching in the FROM line?
2019-05-22 20:43:09	is_null	--no-cache

2019-05-22 21:49:08	nukke	I'm trying to run the markusmcnugen/qbittorrentvpn container, but looking at the logs I get the following error: https://pastebin.com/raw/wCBeDv3J
2019-05-22 21:49:29	nukke	specifically `ERROR: Cannot open TUN/TAP dev /dev/net/tun: No such file or directory (errno=2)`
2019-05-22 21:50:45	nukke	from what I'm reading online, it seems like I need to have OpenVPN installed on the host and the service running, yet it is still not working, and I'm not sure if I understand how /dev/* would be mounted or readable by (or within) the container itself.

2019-05-23 01:43:09	dsg_	any idea why is that
2019-05-23 01:43:35	terror	dsg_ can you elaborate?
2019-05-23 01:44:08	m1dnight_	choice: you  typically run a single application in a docker. So my guess is that most people just rebuild their container when that app has a new update. It's up to you to monitor that I guess.

2019-05-23 01:46:00	m1dnight_	choice: having docker containers update themselves is like asking your software to update itself. it doesn't happen.
2019-05-23 01:46:30	choice	In a docker file, how do you copy a file from host to container?
2019-05-23 01:47:04	m1dnight_	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22907231/copying-files-from-host-to-docker-container
2019-05-23 01:47:08	choice	I guess like this: COPY somefile /
2019-05-23 01:47:10	dsg_	im running docker for mac
2019-05-23 01:47:14	choice	I guess that will copy it to the root.
2019-05-23 01:47:29	m1dnight_	dsg_: can you inspect your docker, and get its ip?
2019-05-23 01:47:45	m1dnight_	I'm not a pro, but I'd start with figuring out if you can ping it from the host. `docker inspect mycontainer`, and then look for the ip address
2019-05-23 01:47:46	dsg_	m1dnight_: 172.17.0.2 is the ip

2019-05-23 04:00:37	Skuggen	Well, the container shares the network with everything else running on the system
2019-05-23 04:00:56	Skuggen	So you could have e.g. port conflicts with native services
2019-05-23 04:01:44	choice	True.
2019-05-23 04:01:49	choice	But I would avoid that.
2019-05-23 04:01:51	Skuggen	And you might unintentionally make services more public than intended
2019-05-23 04:01:57	choice	True.
2019-05-23 04:02:07	choice	That is harder to avoid.
2019-05-23 04:02:21	Skuggen	And only works on Linux, I think
2019-05-23 04:02:26	choice	Thats fine.

2019-05-23 04:02:58	Skuggen	It can be significant, but it depends a lot on what you're running
2019-05-23 04:03:17	Skuggen	Using -p for something like a database cluster can kill the performance pretty bad

2019-05-23 04:05:00	Skuggen	Right, but what gets hit by that extra latency? If it's a user interface it should be fine, but if it's a high-throughput distributed computing system that's a huge latency

2019-05-23 07:31:03	@programmerq	fizbin▸ do you have more than 2gb of ram available to the docker desktop VM? I think it's under the advanced tap under whale icon->preferences.
2019-05-23 07:33:03	fizbin	programmerq: Ah! It hadn't occurred to me that I'd need to check the options there too. I do wish docker gave some sort of warning message/notification when that's an issue.
2019-05-23 07:33:11	@programmerq	mine was at the default of 2gb and 'docker stats' won't show more than the 2gb of the whole node. 'docker inspect <container>' shows the limits as set by the arguments. once I kicked up my vm to 6gb, then 'docker stats' now shows the 5gb limit.

2019-05-23 07:45:45	vegardx	I disagree, but I can see how you can be confused by it. But the confusion stems from lacking basic understanding on how processes work in Linux. It's not unique to containers. You can do the same in JVM if you want.

If you want to add that path to whatever the existing value inside the container should be, it would need to be calculated inside the container at runtime instead of before the container starts.

2019-05-23 08:06:06	@programmerq	fizbin▸ yeah, the whole point of the docker desktop stuff is to get you from zero to able to run containers at all. since macos doesn't run linux binaries, a VM is required. if you don't like the default settings in the docker desktop, you could always switch out to some manually provisioned VM instead. before the docker desktop project, it was pretty typical to provision a virtualbox machine.
2019-05-23 08:06:32	@programmerq	but it didn't have some of the nice things like automatic port forwarding to the VM based on port publishing
2019-05-23 08:07:26	@programmerq	it also didn't have the /var/run/docker.sock forwarding either.

2019-05-23 08:09:38	fizbin	So I think that's part of what isn't exposed, or at least wasn't in what I read: that docker on Mac is a separate Linux VM that then loads and hosts these containers (with port and TTY forwarding) and it's not the case that a custom mini-VM is being spun up and down for each container.

2019-05-23 08:13:32	@programmerq	fizbin▸ common misconception-- docker containers don't do any virtualization at all. they utilize kernel features for isolation like chroot, cgroups, and namespaces. The Docker Desktop project is just to get out of your way so you can install it and run containers. it does run that VM in such a way that it isn't obvious at first, which is neat, but causes confusion too. :)

2019-05-23 10:14:24	@ada	like traefik
2019-05-23 10:14:39	@ada	kubernetes has a native horizontalPodAutoscaler object that can read a metrics API and then Do Stuff
2019-05-23 10:14:40	zumba_ad_	What tool would do what I want?
2019-05-23 10:14:41	swahili	Q: I want to run a command immediately after starting a node service, like run --rm node bash -c 'npm run start'. But I want to allow the user to be able to Ctrl+C and stop the npm process and still access the bash shell. Meanwhile, if I do `run --rm node bash`  and then run the `npm run start` command and after Ctrl+C I get back to the shell prompt.
2019-05-23 10:14:50	zumba_ad_	got it
2019-05-23 10:14:50	swahili	I wonder how to achieve it?
2019-05-23 10:15:05	@ada	zumba_ad_: if you wanted to stick with docker & swarm, then you'd have to have your own metrics backend and some software that can talk to the docker API and then issue "docker service update" as needed
2019-05-23 10:15:20	zumba_ad_	got it
2019-05-23 10:15:48	zumba_ad_	great idea but lots of coding
2019-05-23 10:16:13	@ada	there are some projects out there that try to fill that gap

2019-05-23 10:16:38	zumba_ad_	i'll check it out
2019-05-23 10:17:48	@ada	kubernetes has a couple different options here;  from api 1.1 I think there was support for scaling based on CPU;  since 1.6 they added support for the `metrics-server` backend which gives you a bit more metrics to key off of;  since ~1.10 I think it added support for external (cloud)  metrics providers such as sysdig, datadog, etc.
2019-05-23 10:19:02	zumba_ad_	cool stuff. I'll check out k8s too

2019-05-23 10:33:00	swahili	in the documentation I ask the user to type "npm run start".
2019-05-23 10:33:09	swahili	I can opt to bash -c 'npm run start'
2019-05-23 10:33:16	@ada	why is your container not starting the stuff on its own, is what I'm asking
2019-05-23 10:33:26	@ada	why should your user ever have to shell in _at all_
2019-05-23 10:33:37	swahili	but the difference is that in the first case the bash shell closes completely and in the second don't.
2019-05-23 10:33:48	@ada	why is bash necessary here

2019-05-23 10:34:13	@ada	im saying
2019-05-23 10:34:23	@ada	why should your user ever ever need to be in interactive mode in this container
2019-05-23 10:34:36	@ada	you could write an entrypoint script that does all teh setup and then `exec`s node to start the server
2019-05-23 10:34:43	@ada	then the node server is properly PID1 in the container, and all that
2019-05-23 10:34:52	@ada	and if your user needs to shell in, they should use `docker exec`
2019-05-23 10:35:15	swahili	yeah, but as a frontend dev, some times there's some issues and you need to restart the development server
2019-05-23 10:35:30	@ada	docker restart <container>
2019-05-23 10:35:43	@ada	there shouldn't be a reason to ever shell in and do "kill node && start node"

2019-05-23 10:36:24	@ada	it is technically possible to do the thing you're asking
2019-05-23 10:36:44	@ada	but what you'd be looking is is trying to start a long-lived shell session that won't exit when your stdin disconnects
2019-05-23 10:36:47	@ada	thats tricky in and of itself
2019-05-23 10:36:57	@ada	second, you're trying to run some background processes and keep track of them
2019-05-23 10:37:09	@ada	so you'd need a process supervisor thats owned by your master shell process
2019-05-23 10:37:14	swahili	I'll have in consideration what you said, and rest docker restart container; but when I first tried, felt that it takes longer then ctrl+c and `npm run x`
2019-05-23 10:37:21	@ada	so that "docker kill" works correctly, etc.

2019-05-23 10:49:16	@ada	and you have some volume mounts under your expose: key which is not where they go
2019-05-23 10:49:20	@ada	they have their own volumes:  key
2019-05-23 10:49:50	transhumanist	ok thanks
2019-05-23 10:49:59	@ada	also you use spaces not tabs with yaml

2019-05-23 10:50:22	transhumanist	yeah I thought I had eliminated all my tabs
2019-05-23 10:50:26	@ada	2tabs per indent level is the generally accepted style
2019-05-23 10:50:34	@ada	4 is fine too
2019-05-23 10:50:43	@ada	as long as its consistent throughout the document
2019-05-23 10:50:53	@ada	it looks like you have columns of different sizes
2019-05-23 10:51:36	transhumanist	yikes thats a lot, thanks for all the time !

2019-05-23 11:11:37	swahili	ada: I did a test, started by running `run --service-ports --name node_dev node bash -c 'npm run start'`; Removed the --rm flag I had before to be able to restart, right; When I `restart node_dev`, noticed that it's fast, so you are right. But when I access the localhost:portNumber it shows some markup but seems that the development server does not serve correctly as it shows blank.
2019-05-23 11:12:08	swahili	So, I `rm node_dev` and run node_dev and tried localhost:portNumber and it's ok.
2019-05-23 11:12:38	swahili	I'm not sure how restart works but it failed
2019-05-23 11:12:54	swahili	I'll try to restart the current container to see if the same happens
2019-05-23 11:13:13	swahili	Have to say that I stopped it with Ctrl+C as that'll be the most likely scenario users will do
2019-05-23 11:14:50	swahili	this probably happens because the development server, has hot module reload etc

2019-05-23 16:53:34	zoredache	it  pings things over time. The graph will show you when you drop packets, or get a lot of jitter (variation between reply times)
2019-05-23 16:53:52	zoredache	perhaps more useful if you have a less-stable internet connection
2019-05-23 16:54:17	k2gremlin	Yea probably.. as long as the next hop outside of my house is stable.. I am am happy.
2019-05-23 16:55:02	k2gremlin	But I like the idea.... always open to checking out new containers. Again, home use here so pretty limited on what could be useful to me lol
2019-05-23 16:55:26	zoredache	I use it to monitor some wireless devices because my AP sometimes craps out, or mostly gets unhappy because there are too many neighbors near me that force it to choose bad channels
2019-05-23 16:55:41	zoredache	might also try organizer

2019-05-24 01:45:25	torarne	Q: So, as I understand it, the way docker-proxy works is the reason for e.g. nginx not being able to see the real client IP in logs etc. But when looking at iptables, I see docker rules there. Shouldn't that mean that most of the traffic will not go through the docker-proxy, and still be visible with the real client IP inside the container, without having net=host?
2019-05-24 01:45:43	torarne	This is not swarm or anything, just a normal docker ngnix container

2019-05-24 05:25:37	mike5w3c	if not in a container, the service ships the bind address set to 127.0.0.1 by default, with a startup-time option to have it bind to some other address

2019-05-24 09:43:26	electricbear	ada, so the entrypoint is just the location of the program that excecutes the commands, correct?
2019-05-24 09:43:37	electricbear	/bin/sh for example
2019-05-24 09:43:52	electricbear	and CMD is the list of commands

2019-05-24 09:48:59	@ada	electricbear: so theres a couple things here
2019-05-24 09:49:14	@ada	electricbear: in the dockerfile, CMD and ENTRYPOINT both set the startup command, in different ways
2019-05-24 09:49:19	@ada	and they can be combined
2019-05-24 09:50:18	@ada	in your compose file, you're using command: key in your compose file, which is the same as doing a "docker run ... blog-image python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001"
2019-05-24 09:50:31	electricbear	right
2019-05-24 09:50:32	@ada	which also overrides whatever CMD would be set in your dockerfile
2019-05-24 09:50:39	@ada	you don't have a CMD in your dockerfile, which is fine

2019-05-24 09:51:50	@ada	there are 2 different syntaxes for CMD
2019-05-24 09:51:56	@ada	there's the "shell" and "exec" syntax
2019-05-24 09:52:03	@ada	they invoke your command in different ways

2019-05-24 09:52:43	@ada	electricbear: I think you're using the "shell" form, which means that we wrap your command in a call to sh -c
2019-05-24 09:52:54	@ada	so it supports shell expansion, etc. but requires a shell be available

2019-05-24 09:53:12	@ada	the "exec" form invokes your command directly, without calling a shell first

2019-05-24 09:54:15	electricbear	so is a shell needed to invoke "python -command-"

2019-05-24 10:02:10	electricbear	this might explain why the tutorial works and mine doesn't
2019-05-24 10:02:10	@ada	so your "container user" has a diff UID than the owner of the files on teh host (you)

2019-05-24 10:02:15	electricbear	I went my own way with volumes
2019-05-24 10:02:33	@ada	you might need to do something like user: $(id -u):$(id -g) to map the container user's uid to yours
2019-05-24 10:02:42	@ada	so the interpreter gets the same UID as electricbear
2019-05-24 10:02:44	electricbear	so my volume setup "works"?
2019-05-24 10:02:50	electricbear	it isn't bad practice?
2019-05-24 10:02:51	@ada	its not wrong
2019-05-24 10:02:56	@ada	this is common pattern
2019-05-24 10:03:06	@ada	copy the code to the container, get it up, mount your volume on top so you can edit live
2019-05-24 10:03:09	@ada	and use the same runtime
2019-05-24 10:03:15	@ada	until you're ready to rebuild then you copy teh source in
2019-05-24 10:03:20	electricbear	they aren't files that need to be persistent, jsut wanted access to them

2019-05-24 10:04:22	@ada	that says $(uid my user):$(gid of my group)
2019-05-24 10:04:33	@ada	oh wait
2019-05-24 10:04:36	@ada	that won't work inside compose
2019-05-24 10:04:43	@ada	because that's bash's command expansion syntax
2019-05-24 10:04:51	@ada	that works with docker run   in your shell
2019-05-24 10:04:59	@ada	I would just figure out your uid:gid
2019-05-24 10:05:10	@ada	run it in your shell and find out, its prob like 1000:1000
2019-05-24 10:05:19	@ada	then just set user: 1000:1000 in the compose file

2019-05-24 10:11:54	@ada	if that folder is empty, that explains why python interpreter can't find your manage.py
2019-05-24 10:12:03	@ada	but you mounted an empty volume on top of it

2019-05-24 10:16:09	electricbear	exactly
2019-05-24 10:16:09	@ada	and mysql is going to _create_ a bunch of stuff when it starts
2019-05-24 10:16:16	@ada	in your case, you aren't creating anything
2019-05-24 10:16:26	@ada	your stuff is already in the image
2019-05-24 10:16:34	@ada	in mysqls case, we create the database after the container starts
2019-05-24 10:16:39	@ada	so the volume is already ther
2019-05-24 10:16:54	@ada	in your case, your "stuff" is in the image first - so the container starts and THEN your volume is mounted on top

2019-05-24 10:18:03	@ada	it completely "hides" the contents of the folder underneath
2019-05-24 10:18:12	@ada	and this volume mount happens after your container starts, not during build

2019-05-24 10:18:30	@ada	so during build, you add files to /usr/src/app.  then the container starts, and you mount empty /foo on top of /usr/src/app
2019-05-24 10:18:34	@ada	now /usr/src/foo is empty
2019-05-24 10:18:56	@ada	and you haven't copied anything there, because your command:  calls python start /usr/src/foo/manage.py
2019-05-24 10:19:02	electricbear	I thought that would just make them the same folder
2019-05-24 10:19:04	@ada	and /foo is empty right now so it fails

2019-05-24 10:21:26	@ada	/home/babybear/blog/app rather
2019-05-24 10:21:48	electricbear	is there any point in the COPY at that point? since mounting will put it all there
2019-05-24 10:21:52	@ada	yes and no
2019-05-24 10:22:23	@ada	yes it makes it so you don't have to have 2 different dockerfiles
2019-05-24 10:22:49	@ada	your source is there - so if you are ready to release your image, you just have to build it

2019-05-24 10:24:13	@ada	its not the same exact thing
2019-05-24 10:24:24	@ada	the only things that go into your _image_ are what's in the Dockerfile

2019-05-24 11:02:35	transhumanist	Hi! so I posted a question, but couldn't stay for an answer (unfortunately something came up) sorry for the re-post and thanks in advance
2019-05-24 11:02:36	transhumanist	ok, so now my containers run after being executed from bash script...to docker-compose , there is three containers, I have them all set to run a bash shell, which they do seem to run but exit immediately .. how do I tell why this is is there a log created in some other directory than /var/log?
2019-05-24 11:03:20	@programmerq	if you start up bash without any input and no tty, it exits since it has nothing to do.
2019-05-24 11:03:24	swahili	and def `docker container ls --all` returns empty
2019-05-24 11:03:31	lmat	transhumanist: docker container logs <container>; ?
2019-05-24 11:03:34	@programmerq	that's just bash
2019-05-24 11:03:50	@programmerq	the exited container will show exit code 0
2019-05-24 11:04:06	@programmerq	and bash doesn't output anything special when it has no input, so nothing will be logged.
2019-05-24 11:04:07	lmat	swahili: And what's the problem? You start up the database again and it magically has data already?
2019-05-24 11:04:12	transhumanist	ah ok, why is it different than when I execute it from a terminal?
2019-05-24 11:04:20	transhumanist	the containers I mean
2019-05-24 11:04:27	transhumanist	so for example
2019-05-24 11:04:33	lmat	transhumanist: because bash is hooked up with a standard input (your terminal)
2019-05-24 11:04:39	nacelle	think of it like docker doesnt just start things, it -runs- them.  all the way through.
2019-05-24 11:04:41	@programmerq	when you start a container via docker-compose, it doesn't tell docker to allocate a pseudo-tty for you.
2019-05-24 11:04:41	transhumanist	ah ok I get it thanks
2019-05-24 11:04:42	lmat	transhumanist: So it echos $PS1 and waits for input.
2019-05-24 11:04:43	@programmerq	you can opt in to that

2019-05-24 11:04:55	swahili	lmat: nah the previous data; I'll manually delete the mapped volume and run the test again, takes a few minutes though
2019-05-24 11:05:06	@programmerq	instead, just have docker-compose launch the process that you actually want running in the container instead of a bash shell

2019-05-24 11:05:45	lmat	swahili: Well, there is some directory somewhere that has the database data. Presumeably that is set up as a volume for the container. If that still exists (and is given as a volume to the new container), the new database process in that container will have data.
2019-05-24 11:05:48	transhumanist	actually I plan on passing it commands for darkflow, but I wanted to test it to the point to make sure it works with manual interaction (what i am doing requires interaction between 3 containers
2019-05-24 11:06:03	lmat	swahili: If thot directory is removed, then it cannot be accessed by the container, and the data won't be there. (I must be missing something...)
2019-05-24 11:06:19	@programmerq	transhumanist▸ you can replicated the same behavior by attaching bash's input to a non-interactive tty. Try this: echo | bash
2019-05-24 11:06:28	@programmerq	it'll exit immediately, with exit code 0, printing nothing.
2019-05-24 11:06:36	@programmerq	same thing happens when you tell docker to run bash with no tty
2019-05-24 11:06:43	transhumanist	ah ok thanks I understand now
2019-05-24 11:06:54	transhumanist	makes perfect sense

2019-05-24 11:32:02	@ada	but the default bridge network named "bridge" doesn't do service discovery

2019-05-24 11:32:42	electricbear	sure

2019-05-24 11:33:17	lmat	epinky_: You're wanting to change the port routing rules while the container is running?
2019-05-24 11:33:52	epinky_	lmat: no, the container is stopped at this moment, but if I start it , it gets the same port 5433
2019-05-24 11:33:59	@ada	electricbear: after you "docker-compose up"  your stack, if you "docker network ls" do you have a network called project_default or something
2019-05-24 11:34:06	lmat	epinky_: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19335444
2019-05-24 11:34:10	@ada	project_  would be the name of teh folder containing your compose file
2019-05-24 11:34:38	lmat	epinky_: This says to create a new image from your running container, then run that *image* (as a new container, but it should be the same as the container you just copied) with the new port fortarding.
2019-05-24 11:34:53	electricbear	the project folder is called "blog" (/home/babybear/blog/...) but I don't see that network, just some old ones I need to prune
2019-05-24 11:34:58	electricbear	I can inspect and see if it's in bridge
2019-05-24 11:35:15	@ada	yeah its important to note that theres the bridge driver and the "bridge" network
2019-05-24 11:35:26	@ada	the network called simply "bridge" is a legacy network and doesn't do service discovery
2019-05-24 11:35:29	electricbear	ada they are both in the network "bridge"
2019-05-24 11:35:31	electricbear	I did inspect bridge
2019-05-24 11:35:36	@ada	ok then thats the problem
2019-05-24 11:35:46	@ada	what version of compose API are you using
2019-05-24 11:36:01	electricbear	3.6 for this, my others are 2
2019-05-24 11:36:02	lmat	epinky_: Then you'll need to listen to this twice through before starting your container. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID5rrL1U-xI
2019-05-24 11:36:10	@ada	ok theres differences in teh syntax, so for this use case
2019-05-24 11:36:17	@ada	let me check
2019-05-24 11:36:25	electricbear	i'm curious though if thats the case
2019-05-24 11:36:36	electricbear	how do my other services like nextcloud find their DB? they are in bridge
2019-05-24 11:37:32	@ada	so for this use case, you should be able to take network_mode: bridge out and re-deploy
2019-05-24 11:37:35	@ada	and they should be able to find each other
2019-05-24 11:37:43	@ada	network_mode bridge isn't really necessary in this use case

2019-05-24 11:38:14	electricbear	well in the grand scheme, I want to pass this to an nginx-proxy that provides HTTPS
2019-05-24 11:38:15	@ada	so the default "bridge" network doesn't do DNS for containers - but you _could_ use your docker host's IP and the published port instead to hook up containers on the default "bridge" network
2019-05-24 11:38:23	@ada	but you'd have to know all of the ports you are publishing
2019-05-24 11:38:24	electricbear	and that proxy handles ALL my containers on the network birdge
2019-05-24 11:38:34	@ada	ah so I get that
2019-05-24 11:38:46	@ada	but you want to use a diff network, a bridge driver network but not "bridge" itself
2019-05-24 11:39:05	electricbear	I have no idea what the difference is
2019-05-24 11:39:17	electricbear	I just thought the network 'bridge' was a vlan that they used
2019-05-24 11:39:23	@ada	technically yes
2019-05-24 11:39:32	@ada	but what we're after requires us to use a user-defined network

2019-05-24 11:39:47	@ada	the default network called "bridge" is lame;  it doesn't do most of the features we want.  its a legacy network from the original docker days
2019-05-24 11:39:55	electricbear	let me show you my other compose for nextcloud and tell me the difference in why it works
2019-05-24 11:40:52	@ada	if I didn't have compose, I would do something like "docker network create frontend && docker run -d --network frontend --network backend wordpress && docker run -d --network backend mysql"
2019-05-24 11:41:06	@ada	and then I'd attach my proxy to the frontend network
2019-05-24 11:41:16	@ada	and then my proxy can only talk to my wordpress, and only wordpress can talk to mysql
2019-05-24 11:41:25	@ada	because proxy isn't attached to backend, and wordpress is attached to both
2019-05-24 11:41:31	@ada	in compose, you can do the same thing

2019-05-24 11:41:54	@ada	on a single host, the bridge _driver_ is default

2019-05-24 11:42:47	@ada	thats the reason
2019-05-24 11:42:53	@ada	that is a legacy feature before "networks" were added
2019-05-24 11:42:55	epinky_	lmat: I did this, ran a docker, then restored dump, bu then I wondered that I need to change port
2019-05-24 11:42:59	electricbear	fuck
2019-05-24 11:43:12	@ada	so on the bridge network, the --link operator used to be used before networks were a feature
2019-05-24 11:43:18	electricbear	so technically nextcloud-server and nextcloud-db don't even use the VLAN?
2019-05-24 11:43:25	@ada	no it traverses the bridge
2019-05-24 11:43:52	electricbear	isn't "bridge" a network???
2019-05-24 11:43:54	zerocool	hi yall, im new to docker, currently we are connecting containers to their bridge ip's but we'd like this to be less fragile, how can containers find each other by name, like what is the best route for resolution?
2019-05-24 11:44:00	@ada	electricbear: "bridge" is an overloaded term
2019-05-24 11:44:04	electricbear	clearly haha
2019-05-24 11:44:13	electricbear	I am strictly referring to the network named "bridge"
2019-05-24 11:44:19	@ada	electricbear: we have several:  the bridge docker network driver.  the "bridge" network. and linux virtual interfaces called "bridges"
2019-05-24 11:44:33	lmat	epinky_: Gotta go right now, but I trust you'll get it sorted soon!
2019-05-24 11:44:43	@ada	zerocool: use user-defined networks
2019-05-24 11:44:49	@ada	this is what me and electricbear are talking about
2019-05-24 11:44:51	zerocool	also, when i say bridge i mean the builtin docker network "bridge"
2019-05-24 11:44:55	electricbear	so what does 'network_mode: bridge' specifically mean?
2019-05-24 11:45:01	epinky_	lmat: ok, thanks
2019-05-24 11:45:04	zerocool	ada: and then use staic ip's or assign ip addreses?
2019-05-24 11:45:04	@ada	electricbear: in your use case, its kind of a non-sequiter
2019-05-24 11:45:16	zerocool	or is there some sort of name resultion with a user-defined network>?
2019-05-24 11:45:27	@ada	zerocool: there is
2019-05-24 11:45:32	@ada	zerocool: but only with user-defined

2019-05-24 11:46:53	electricbear	please help me understand my current situation though
2019-05-24 11:47:23	@ada	electricbear: your containers on the "bridge" network would have "private" IPs
2019-05-24 11:47:28	electricbear	yes they do
2019-05-24 11:47:37	@ada	electricbear: --link basically sets up some environment vars to let them reach each other
2019-05-24 11:47:43	@ada	it does some /etc/hosts stuff in the container basically
2019-05-24 11:47:46	electricbear	instead of through DNS
2019-05-24 11:47:48	@ada	right

2019-05-24 11:48:03	electricbear	I don't mind it being archaic
2019-05-24 11:48:04	@ada	sure
2019-05-24 11:48:26	@ada	but the new behaviour is that as long as your containers are attached to the same user-defined network, we should resolve their container or service name to their private IP
2019-05-24 11:48:32	electricbear	so they still need to be on the network though
2019-05-24 11:48:46	@ada	on _at least 1_ network yes

2019-05-24 12:12:34	@programmerq	I wouldn't expect nginx to use that much ram at all, which has nothing to do with whether it's containerized or not.
2019-05-24 12:12:53	jadax	are you saying there is no overhead when using docker + nginx vs just nginx?
2019-05-24 12:13:05	@programmerq	do you have output of top or ps showing your containerized process uses that much ram?
2019-05-24 12:13:25	jadax	I'm running project built by somebody else - there are few containers all together

2019-05-24 13:31:08	transhumanist	hi! Whats the difference between a runtime and a container. all the examples I find show nvidia container running as a runtime instead of as service in the docker-compose.yml thanks
2019-05-24 13:33:14	@programmerq	a runtime is an implementation of a container. There's three that I'm aware of that you can drop into docker-- there's the one it comes with (runc), the nvidia runtime, and gvisor (runsc). basically it's an implementation of containers that docker can utilize.
2019-05-24 13:33:44	@programmerq	the nvidia runtime basically is a normal container, but it has some extra logic to present the GPU hardware to the containerized process.

2019-05-24 13:36:33	transhumanist	I take it it cant be done this way?
2019-05-24 13:37:00	zoredache	so how does the '--restart-max-attempts' work in swarm?   Is that value a total over the life of the service?  Or is there a way to have it give up if it restarts a few times in an 10 minutes, but restart always if it spaced out?

2019-05-24 16:35:27	@ada	i actually recommend traefik over jwilder/nginx-proxy
2019-05-24 16:35:39	@ada	i don't really have a dog in that fight but I like traefik
2019-05-24 16:35:48	@ada	it can be a little much to configure, the docs are kind of spread out

2019-05-24 16:36:03	cim209	i think traefik is much easier
2019-05-24 16:36:07	@ada	and that my proxy should join those networks as needed
2019-05-24 16:36:12	@ada	and remove itself from those networks as needed
2019-05-24 16:36:18	@ada	now, traefik doesn't do that yet but it will
2019-05-24 16:36:34	@ada	so right now I'm accepting the fact that I use one global "proxy" network that I stick my frontends on

2019-05-24 16:37:43	@ada	you ahve 2 options, and you can mix them;  you can update your proxy and add networks to it
2019-05-24 16:37:51	@ada	or you can deploy all your frontends attached to the same network
2019-05-24 16:38:45	@ada	in your use case, jwilder/nginx-proxy would need to be attached to "bridge" and also "project_blog"
2019-05-24 16:38:52	@ada	or "blog_default" or whatever it's called
2019-05-24 16:42:26	electricbear	I'm sticking with jwilder for now but will consider other options
2019-05-24 16:42:35	@ada	it works
2019-05-24 16:42:46	@ada	I don't have a problem with it i just happen to use a diff tool
2019-05-24 16:42:47	electricbear	so I can just attach blog to two networks and it will find it by DNS I assume

2019-05-24 16:57:45	@ada	im pretty sure jwilder/nginx-proxy reads the docker api
2019-05-24 16:57:51	@ada	it looks for those labels you set on your services
2019-05-24 16:58:15	@ada	it programs an nginx.conf file with "server" "upstreams" to set up nginx as a proxy
2019-05-24 16:58:47	@ada	then, when your request hits the proxy container, nginx examines the Host header and/or the request URI (https & SNI) to determine which upstream to send that request to
2019-05-24 16:59:18	@ada	and yes, it programs the "upstreams" in nginx.conf using the container's name, which leverage's docker's service discovery backend
2019-05-24 16:59:49	@ada	with your stuff on bridge, since service discovery isn't there, this might not work correctlt.  I don't know if jwilder/nginx-proxy is able to program based on IP:port instead

2019-05-25 10:12:35	maxxer	I'm having troubles building an image with a Dockerfile. I use two temporary build images to make the final, and in the final steps I copy data from a remporary to the final one. Out of three commands the middle one doesn't copy anyhing. Well, apparently it does, because if I run a temporary shell in the last stage image the files are present, but when I do "docker run" with the image the dir is empty. It's driving me crazy

Is it the last service specified or is it the one that you have specified tty:true  and /bin/bash? weird problem is its opening the container without any traces of darknet in it even though I am using the latest tag for it!

2019-05-26 14:34:48	perplexabot	Hello, all. I am another docker noob. I have been trying to build and run a minimal Dockerfile that pulls/uses jenkins/jenkins:lts. My dockerfile is two lines, one to use jenkins/jenkins:lts (FROM) and another to touch a file to /var/jenkins_home/ (using RUN). I also have an `ls -l` post file touch (in my RUN statement) to verify that file gets created, and it does. When I run the container and exec in, then
2019-05-26 14:34:49	akik	niekniek: you just started it with "docker run ..." ?
2019-05-26 14:34:50	perplexabot	go to /var/jenkins_home I see that the file is removed. I can't figure out why, I have been at this for a while. Can anyone provide some help or point me in the right direction please? I have also created a stackoverflow post but did not receive much help (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56162642/docker-jenkins-image-and-known-hosts-file).

2019-05-26 14:45:56	niekniek	from the site: My advice is to run composer install locally before building the container. This is what I do before I build my containers, that way I can use the same containers for development that I use for deployments.

2019-05-26 18:27:54	miscapples	I've attempted to learn about Docker countless times now, but each time, I am forced to give up in frustration after installing it (Windows) and then looking through its menus and seeing nothing resembling any kind of "Container setup wizard" or anything. I'm trying to run PHP with the PCNTL extension, but that extension doesn't support Windows. So I am forced to make a "container" with some sort of Linux "engine" (?), with PHP and PostgreSQL. Why
2019-05-26 18:27:54	miscapples	can't I figure out how to do this after downloading the Docker thing? Why does the website's instructions make me look like a question mark? Why is nothing the way it seems about Docker? I feel like I'm missing something.

2019-05-26 20:33:28	miscapples	Well, it really frustrates me that they promise the world and beyond, and anyone mentioning Docker seems almost extatic, but then I actually try to use it and I have no idea what to do. And I'm no beginner in regards to most things computer.
2019-05-26 20:33:40	miscapples	But I am a perpetual hater of lacking documentation/clear instructions.

2019-05-26 21:13:35	miscapples	It gets very specific and very weird.
2019-05-26 21:16:25	cim209	it's pretty self explanitory on the dockerfile

2019-05-26 21:20:06	miscapples	It isn't at all clear how Docker works based on reading that page. To me-.
2019-05-26 21:20:24	cim209	the dockerfile is used to create a new and custom image
2019-05-26 21:20:30	effprime	it might help to know how flask works
2019-05-26 21:20:32	cim209	which the container will use

2019-05-26 21:21:53	miscapples	"A registry is a collection of repositories, and a repository is a collection of images—sort of like a GitHub repository, except the code is already built. An account on a registry can create many repositories. The docker CLI uses Docker’s public registry by default." <-- This in particular I've tried to read many times now but I don't get what a "registry" is supposed to be.
2019-05-26 21:22:02	miscapples	effprime: Never heard of "flask" before.
2019-05-26 21:22:22	effprime	then how do you expect to understand the context of the python scripts?
2019-05-26 21:22:32	miscapples	It almost sounds like they are referring to "cloud host supporting Docker".
2019-05-26 21:22:43	miscapples	effprime: No idea. I don't use Python.
2019-05-26 21:22:53	effprime	what app do you want docker for?
2019-05-26 21:23:05	miscapples	PHP and PostgreSQL.
2019-05-26 21:23:10	miscapples	(CLI)
2019-05-26 21:23:14	effprime	and apache I assume
2019-05-26 21:23:17	miscapples	Nope.
2019-05-26 21:23:31	cim209	good, don't use that bloat
2019-05-26 21:23:34	effprime	what is your project for?
2019-05-26 21:24:19	miscapples	Trying to escape the limitation of PHP not supporting PCNTL on Windows.
2019-05-26 21:24:28	miscapples	So it has to be a Docker container.
2019-05-26 21:24:45	miscapples	Plus to be able to "hand it over as one file" later.
2019-05-26 21:24:48	cim209	oh windows..oo
2019-05-26 21:25:08	effprime	well, I have never used PHP to write to a database
2019-05-26 21:25:13	effprime	but you prob want two containers
2019-05-26 21:25:30	effprime	and a docker-compose file outlining both of them
2019-05-26 21:25:42	miscapples	"then how do you expect to understand the context of the python scripts?" <-- I don't even know what you meant by that question.
2019-05-26 21:25:49	miscapples	Two containers?
2019-05-26 21:26:02	miscapples	Isn't the whole thing that everything is put into the same "thing"?
2019-05-26 21:26:16	effprime	yes, one container for the PHP and another for Post
2019-05-26 21:26:23	effprime	but I have no idea what your project is actually doing

2019-05-27 08:07:25	agowa338	dilema: does docker-php-ext-configure exist within the image?
2019-05-27 08:08:48	dilema	agowa338, It is only in my build folder
2019-05-27 08:08:56	agowa338	dilema: to check that you use the hash docker build provides you and just `docker run -it <<HASH>> /bin/sh` it. Than on the new prompt just try the command and see what happens. I expect it either not being within the image or in some other path.
2019-05-27 08:10:11	agowa338	dilema: Than you need to copy the file into the image first.

2019-05-27 12:05:05	bluesmonk	no, the things in your yaml file are environment variables passed to the container
2019-05-27 12:05:22	bluesmonk	what you are doing is
2019-05-27 12:05:27	bluesmonk	with docker-compose up
2019-05-27 12:05:54	bluesmonk	"create a container based on the mysql image, and pass it these environment variables please"
2019-05-27 12:05:59	bluesmonk	the guys at mysql created this image
2019-05-27 12:06:20	bluesmonk	so when it is first launched, it will scan for those environment variables and will create databases accordingly
2019-05-27 12:06:23	dickgrayson	there seems to be a number of different ways to do thee same thing?
2019-05-27 12:06:29	bluesmonk	it's just one way
2019-05-27 12:06:34	dickgrayson	like for instance you can also use docker run
2019-05-27 12:06:44	dickgrayson	I haven't used docker run just docker-compose up
2019-05-27 12:07:06	bluesmonk	those are two different things and tools

2019-05-27 12:08:02	bluesmonk	using docker-compose, when you do docker-compose up for the first time, you will end with a bunch of new instances, defined in the docker-compose file. those can be services, networks and other stuff
2019-05-27 12:08:06	dickgrayson	so when would i use docker run and when would i need to use docker-compose up?
2019-05-27 12:08:15	bluesmonk	fuck
2019-05-27 12:08:18	bluesmonk	i'm done
2019-05-27 12:08:26	bluesmonk	I'm sorry
2019-05-27 12:08:49	dickgrayson	np
2019-05-27 12:09:42	bluesmonk	docker run is for running a single command
2019-05-27 12:09:46	monkers	does macvlan automatically bridge with the hosts physical network if i specicy the parent interface ?
2019-05-27 12:09:59	bluesmonk	docker compose does that along with many other commands for binding everything together
2019-05-27 12:10:49	bluesmonk	so, you need to read the mysql documentation, and read the basics of compose, or else improve your asking skills
2019-05-27 12:10:58	bluesmonk	I wish you the best

2019-05-28 02:03:33	vangap	Hi, I have `too many open files` issue on containers on mac ( Docker Desktop.)
2019-05-28 02:03:34	vangap	I believe it’s because of lower limit on the docker daemon perhaps.. (Host ulimit (sysctl kern.maxfiles) is high and also the ulimit in the container is high enough)
2019-05-28 02:03:34	vangap	so, I suspect that the per process limit for the docker daemon/hyperkit is low or the user with which docker daemon is being started has different limits
2019-05-28 02:03:34	vangap	Has anyone run into this issue or has some info that can help me narrow it down?
2019-05-28 02:06:22	tinyhippo	you have to do a thing

2019-05-28 03:38:14	torarne	Q: Due to the way docker works I'm not seeing the real IP in the container nginx is running, but I do have it from Cloudflare. Is there any difference between set_real_ip_from 172.17.0.0/16; and set_real_ip_from 0.0.0.0/0;? If everything goes though the docker bridge anyways, won't the former be just as insecure as the latter?

2019-05-28 03:39:48	tabakhase	now, CF is nice and exposes "to trust" adresses on an api, https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4 & https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v6
2019-05-28 03:40:21	torarne	tabakhase: right, that's what I was thinking too. if they connect directly to the origin server, then the real ip can be spoofed. so the set_real_ip_from 172.17.0.0/16; gives a false sense of security, it's really 0.0.0.0/0;
2019-05-28 03:40:40	avu	r007z: thanks for investigating :)
2019-05-28 03:41:30	torarne	tabakhase: i've set up both ip whitelisting at the fw, and authenticated origin pulls, so that's what will hopefully provide the security of accepting  Cf-Connecting-Ip as the real ip. CF at least seems to block attempts to pass a spoofed Cf-Connecting-Ip
2019-05-28 03:42:05	tabakhase	torarne its a bit more complicated rly... 0.0.0.0 would be "anything", but you really want "trusted", 172. is in that manner "trusted" cause its a local-only/routing interface

2019-05-28 03:44:57	torarne	tabakhase: right, but effectively they are the same aren't they? since all the traffic coming into the container would be from the 172. ip. i would never see any "real" public ips that would then be dissalowed by a 172 mask, but allowed by /0, so in practice trusting 172. means i'm trusting every client connecting to the docker container

2019-05-28 07:43:00	@programmerq	if you want to use the docker logging system, the containerized application would need to write to stdout. You can use a docker logging driver to change the behavior of the docker logging system. If your containerized process is configured to write to a file in a volume instead of stdout, then the docker logging system won't be involved at all.

2019-05-28 07:43:30	fata	 would you recommend the logging system to be writing to a file or configuring docker to do so?
2019-05-28 07:43:47	@programmerq	docker's logging system comes with several drivers.
2019-05-28 07:43:55	@programmerq	pulling up link
2019-05-28 07:44:40	@programmerq	https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/dual-logging/ -- on the left there's a section titled 'logging driver details' that you can expand for details on the specific driver.
2019-05-28 07:44:45	fata	yeah i do see something like https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/
2019-05-28 07:44:53	fata	but it doesn't seem like you can specify paths
2019-05-28 07:45:00	@programmerq	correct, that one isn't meant to change the path
2019-05-28 07:45:19	@programmerq	you could pass the logs to a syslog server though using the syslog driver, and your syslog server could be configured to do whatever you want with it.
2019-05-28 07:45:32	@programmerq	(including custom path/location)

2019-05-28 07:47:02	@programmerq	and once you solve that, you can set up your dockerd to have its default logging driver use your syslog and configuration and all your containers that use the docker logging system will be logged the way you want (assuming you want the same behavior across the board)
2019-05-28 07:47:19	@programmerq	and you can do that with off the shelf containers that don't all need to be individually customized

2019-05-28 09:17:34	@programmerq	g1eb▸ your user needs permission to access the docker api. by default, that is the /var/lib/docker.sock socket. If you put a user into the docker group, then it can access it. you could also set up TLS and access it that way.

2019-05-28 09:19:01	@programmerq	you'd need to have a restart policy for the thing consuming postgres, assuming it is set up to exit on a database error.
2019-05-28 09:19:26	@programmerq	if it doesn't need to exit/restart on a database error, then you just need to wait for the database import script to finish and no exit/restart is necessary.

This seems to be gitlab's recommendation: https://blog.xiaket.org/2017/exposing.ssh.port.in.dockerized.gitlab-ce.html to have a bash script on the host forward git ssh connection to the container. But on #gitlab I was told that some users are just using a second ip

2019-05-28 09:31:12	@programmerq	I think you could do that if the dockerd on the host had its default listen range changed from 0.0.0.0 to one of its aliased ips instead. you'd also need to configure the ssh on that host to only listen on the primary interface.

2019-05-28 11:20:50	CoolerZ	do docker containers maintain state?
2019-05-28 11:21:06	@programmerq	"maintain state" -- elaborate?
2019-05-28 11:21:07	CoolerZ	I downloaded a container and ran it, made some changes
2019-05-28 11:21:20	CoolerZ	then the laptop abruptly shutdown
2019-05-28 11:21:27	@programmerq	images are immutable
2019-05-28 11:21:35	CoolerZ	so the changes are lost?
2019-05-28 11:21:36	@programmerq	if you fire up a container, it does get its own write layer
2019-05-28 11:21:55	@programmerq	if your laptop shuts down, the container still exists
2019-05-28 11:21:57	@programmerq	but it is stopped
2019-05-28 11:22:08	@programmerq	start it again and anything on that write layer will still be there
2019-05-28 11:22:10	@programmerq	however
2019-05-28 11:22:22	@programmerq	the write layer isn't the best place to put stateful data-- put that into a volume instead.
2019-05-28 11:22:42	@programmerq	if you start another container using the same immutable image as you've used before, the changes in the previous container's write layer won't be present

2019-05-28 11:23:05	@programmerq	"docker run" is a shortcut for "docker create" and "docker start", so every "docker run" is a new container.
2019-05-28 11:23:17	@ada	zzlatev: you'd have to ask the maintainers of that distribution? im assuming that's what that is
2019-05-28 11:23:27	@programmerq	'docker container ls' only shows running containers by default, so do 'docker container ls -a' to show all containers.

2019-05-28 12:13:59	fraggeln	but, when I fiddle around to build images, I sometimes cheat by logging in to the containers to add stuff, for testing.
2019-05-28 12:14:00	CoreyW	bc right now i'm using docker-compose.yml with `command: sh -c 'npm install && npm start'` to avoid rebuilding, but it feels wrong
2019-05-28 12:14:28	fraggeln	but I have a pipeline to build images, so I just use git commit and it rebuilds
2019-05-28 12:14:49	CoreyW	fraggeln: yeah i get that. but since package.json/package-lock.json aren't really hand-edited files, they are generated from running npm scripts, which i can only run when the node container is running.

2019-05-28 12:24:18	fraggeln	CoreyW: it should be a part of the Dockerfile imho.
2019-05-28 12:24:29	twobitsprite	CoreyW: then look up the current version and add it to the requirements.txt

2019-05-28 12:43:28	@programmerq	docker toolbox?
2019-05-28 12:43:47	dr_y	docker desktop, windows 10
2019-05-28 12:43:58	dr_y	just ran the .msi, if I recall...
2019-05-28 12:44:07	twobitsprite	CoreyW: in fact, what I do is a multi-stage build, where a "builder" image has the full setup-tools/pip/etc suite install, the a `RUN pip install --target=/tmp/pip -r requirements.txt`, then in a second stage do a "COPY --from-builder /tmp/pip /usr/lib/python3.7/..."
2019-05-28 12:44:34	@programmerq	are you trying to run linux or windows containers? You should see what mode you are in by right clicking on the whale icon in the tray.

2019-05-28 12:44:52	twobitsprite	CoreyW: well, with the RUN way you'll have to rebuild the image if the requirements.txt changes, but otherwise, you won't have to pip install every time after that

2019-05-28 12:45:21	dr_y	linux, I believe. Context menu shows option for "Switch to Windows containers..."
2019-05-28 12:45:25	CoreyW	twobitsprite: yeah exactly. makes sense.
2019-05-28 12:46:06	@programmerq	dr_y▸ try doing the reset option and see if that fixes it. it'll delete any anonymous/named volumes, images, and any existing containers.
2019-05-28 12:46:16	@programmerq	it should appropriately warn
2019-05-28 12:46:28	@programmerq	also, double check the advanced configuration-- I can't remember which tab it is under.
2019-05-28 12:47:10	dr_y	just "Restart..." from the whale menu?
2019-05-28 12:48:18	jayjo	I need to share a directory in a container with a host, when it is a subdirectory of an already defined volume. Does order matter in the declaration? Is this going to be possible to do or do I need to extend the image first? there are three volumes defined here: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile#L41 including one at /var/opt/gitlab when I need to share the volume at
2019-05-28 12:48:24	jayjo	/var/opt/gitlab/.ssh and the hosts /home/git/.ssh

2019-05-28 12:50:18	@programmerq	dr_y▸ well, there's restart, yeah. worth trying it. if you go all the way into the preferences window, there should be a reset as well, which basically starts the linux VM over from scratch.
2019-05-28 12:51:05	@programmerq	it's the easy "fix this thing" hammer that's worth trying if you're not attached to the images/volume data in there.
2019-05-28 12:51:07	dr_y	cool. The restart option did the trick
2019-05-28 12:51:15	@programmerq	cool
2019-05-28 12:51:54	dr_y	The "hammer" fix is good to know in my novice learning mode
2019-05-28 12:52:18	dr_y	but how else could I see more detail to see what caused this problem?
2019-05-28 12:52:45	@programmerq	I wouldn't dwell on it.
2019-05-28 12:53:11	dr_y	lol. Cool. Thanks for your help

2019-05-28 12:56:32	@programmerq	no, docker-machine commands would have nothing to do with the docker desktop instance of docker.

2019-05-28 15:30:03	oss_fan	Ah- that's a great idea, jrabbit - I'll just do a docker volume inspect for all the volumes I care about backing up data from (I use named volumes). I'll grab the Mountpoint value and do an archival copy or similar to my backup area. That way as long as the usage/output of docker volume inspect doesn't change, I'm golden. Thanks!

2019-05-28 17:25:57	dickgrayson	wheen docker install postgres, is this working indepedently of the db installed outside the cointainer? or is the db outside the container being forwarded to the db inside the docker container? I have never really understood this. If postgres is getting installed inside the docker container, than why should it need any db being installed on the linux machine outidee the docker container than?

2019-05-28 17:28:01	dickgrayson	but my symfony forces me to specify a useername and password. Why is it asking me for that than like it has to match something if it is insider the bloody docker container?!! My docker-compose up fails BECAUSE the database url password is incorrect.

2019-05-28 21:04:53	sj0rz	ohi, i'm trying to run this cdocker-compose file https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/blob/master/docker-compose.yml, it starts fine (with internet access), starts downloading dependencies
2019-05-28 21:05:07	sj0rz	but then after a while its nick obtains an ip address which i can see in my i3 status bar
2019-05-28 21:05:17	sj0rz	and then both the host and the container lose internet connection
2019-05-28 21:05:26	sj0rz	i'm confused about what is happening, anyone any idea?

2019-05-29 04:31:22	tabakhase	for other stuff, inc things you had via machine your homedir likely has some ~/.docker or ~/.machine too

2019-05-29 04:44:02	isomari	renihs: I'm not docker expert but I had to add rules that docker would not alter. Put your iptables rules in a file and call that file in the systemctl docker file in hthe Unit section:
2019-05-29 04:44:08	isomari	the line is: ExecStartPost=/etc/docker_iptables/docker_iptables.sh
2019-05-29 04:44:26	isomari	of course you'll point to the file you create.
2019-05-29 04:44:26	renihs	hmmm
2019-05-29 04:44:56	isomari	worked for me.

2019-05-29 04:53:21	Lachezar	renihs: You *could* create an --internal network with Docker, and add a container in two networks to act as a router.
2019-05-29 04:53:47	Lachezar	renihs: Also. Maybe fidding with "Options"."com.docker.network.bridge.host_binding_ipv4": "0.0.0.0" might be your answer?
2019-05-29 04:53:56	renihs	Lachezar: yeah i was thinking about that, but that sounds like overkill
2019-05-29 04:54:05	renihs	Lachezar: i am using that
2019-05-29 04:54:36	renihs	example: com.docker.network.bridge.host_binding_ipv4: 10.200.200.10
2019-05-29 04:55:06	renihs	which plugs all containers there, which works for incoming (dnat) stuff, but if the container connects outside -> it uses the primary IP (due to masquerade)
2019-05-29 04:55:15	renihs	therefore i use: com.docker.network.bridge.enable_ip_masquerade: 0
2019-05-29 04:55:22	renihs	and add the SNAT manually -> which gets removed :)
2019-05-29 04:57:43	Lachezar	renihs: Add the rules to the 'DOCKER-USER' chain?

2019-05-29 08:48:28	_Raijin	In my app, I have nginx and django working together. In my nginx config, I make references to my django container for proxy passes and such. However, when I try to deploy this compose app to a stack, it fails. I think this is because my nginx config is referencing a static container name which is not supported by swarm. What is a good workaround?
2019-05-29 08:48:51	@programmerq	_Raijin▸ show your compose file and nginx config
2019-05-29 08:49:06	@programmerq	use a paste service. I tend to like gist since it has multi-file support, but use whatever you like.
2019-05-29 08:50:19	indomitable	programmerq, what's the "good" way of making containers interact?

2019-05-29 08:52:38	indomitable	s9 far I just set up the containers and find their ips internally
2019-05-29 08:52:39	indomitable	but it's tedious
2019-05-29 08:55:15	@programmerq	which orchestration system are you using? regular containers? swarm? (I'm guessing not k8s)

2019-05-29 08:56:13	@programmerq	I have a little github repo with a working example of Docker's built in service discovery. there's instructions for both swarm's 'docker stack deploy' and regular containers with 'docker-compose'
2019-05-29 08:56:22	@programmerq	https://github.com/programmerq/scaletest
2019-05-29 08:56:36	prometh	i'm really confused.. i install some dependencies at "build" step via RUN, which i `ls` to see they exist, but later at the "up" step they don't show with `ls`
2019-05-29 08:57:10	@programmerq	prometh▸ are you installing them to a location in the image that has been designated as a VOLUME ?
2019-05-29 08:57:30	@programmerq	you'll get an anonymous volume at every subsequent build step and run, which gets cleaned up.
2019-05-29 08:57:35	prometh	programmerq: i copy the files into the image and all work is performed there
2019-05-29 08:57:43	@programmerq	copy how?
2019-05-29 08:57:47	prometh	COPY
2019-05-29 08:58:07	@programmerq	okay-- is there a VOLUME instruction anywhere (including in the FROM image you've specified)?
2019-05-29 08:58:21	prometh	no
2019-05-29 08:58:28	prometh	but the build is initiated from docker-compose.yml
2019-05-29 08:58:30	@programmerq	that was a fast no-- did you definitely check the base image?
2019-05-29 08:58:34	prometh	where i have a volumes value of ".:/app"
2019-05-29 08:58:49	@programmerq	is this missing file under /app in the image?
2019-05-29 08:58:59	prometh	hmm, i didn't check the base image (node:12)

2019-05-29 09:00:53	@programmerq	prometh▸ then your . that gets shared in to /app will mask anything that was at that location in the image. volumes use a linux bind mount so anything that was there previously is masked
2019-05-29 09:01:12	prometh	masked?
2019-05-29 09:01:16	@programmerq	similarly, if I mount a flash drive over top of my /var, the contents of the flash drive would be accessible at /var and anything at /var wouldn't be accessible
2019-05-29 09:01:19	@programmerq	it's the nature of mounting

2019-05-29 09:01:55	@programmerq	could be any directory

2019-05-29 09:02:52	@programmerq	same thing happens in docker when you use the volume system
2019-05-29 09:03:24	@programmerq	whatever you mount at that location, . to /app in the container in this example, will be there and not what was there previously (the files you put there in the image)

2019-05-29 09:49:22	@programmerq	the point of a docker image is to be a build artifact that has your thing and all its dependencies
2019-05-29 09:49:33	@programmerq	so build your dockerfile with that in mind
2019-05-29 09:49:45	@programmerq	that's where you were, and commenting these things out constitute a step backwards

2019-05-29 09:50:32	@programmerq	so going back to where you were, the problem is that your working code and your npm dependencies are in the same place.
2019-05-29 09:51:04	@programmerq	what I would probably do in your shoes, is use the npm install --prefix so the node_modules directory ends up somewhere other than /app

2019-05-29 09:52:51	@programmerq	but
2019-05-29 09:53:07	@programmerq	you need to account for the fact that the installed dependencies are getting masked since you are installing them to a location you are overriding at runtime

2019-05-29 12:32:30	LACampbell	how do you deal with docker containers that run scripts, where the contents can change?

2019-05-29 12:34:18	zoredache	LACampbell: I mean it depends on how dynamic it needs to be.  You could mount a script into a container depending on what you are doing.

2019-05-29 17:57:16	njka	the idea is that the containers are to be launched in a very very predictible state
2019-05-29 17:58:17	njka	importing shit from different places is a good way to break that dependability

2019-05-30 06:06:54	steeznson	thanks for the advice though, will move on to understanding compose a bit better after I've got the fundamentals down a bit better
2019-05-30 06:07:50	tabakhase	i´d see compose mostly as a tool to "not have run.sh" or "copypaste this 700character bash command from the readme" ;-)

2019-05-30 06:08:26	EdwardIII	we tend to take compose out of the picture when we use docker in our CI and run it all directly with docker so it's handy for things like that too
2019-05-30 06:08:33	ilmu	tabakhase: thanks
2019-05-30 06:08:38	tabakhase	so you may want to use -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432 anyways... ilmu
2019-05-30 06:09:07	tabakhase	(this default can be set in dockerd-config, and i belive some distros even ship it as 127.0.0.1)
2019-05-30 06:09:36	ilmu	it just gives me invalid port
2019-05-30 06:10:11	tabakhase	(0.0.0.0 is a magic-ip, that means "all ips on all interfaces" - its not an adress you can actually connect to)
2019-05-30 06:10:17	ilmu	it would be nice to be able to use some command to list the interfaces instead of relying on the default or specifying it explicitly in the config

2019-05-30 06:11:06	ilmu	psql -U postgres -p=<stuff listed here> for example 0.0.0.0:5432, just 5432, 127.0.0.1:5432 and the same with :5432:5432..
2019-05-30 06:11:09	tabakhase	or even "public" if its a server
2019-05-30 06:12:08	ilmu	lol you really know your listener
2019-05-30 06:12:39	tabakhase	"some command" wouldnt make too much sene there... its usually one of 3 cases, "all", "localhost only", or "targetting this specific IP based on local settings" ((say, server has 3 IP adresses and you want port80 on one to nginx, but run an apache on the other IP:80)

2019-05-30 06:17:01	ilmu	tbh I am quite confused what is actually happening, the config files seem straight forward enough but now I'm at the point where I may be debugging my application rather than configuring docker and I have no idea how to touch it

2019-05-30 06:17:53	ilmu	so my next step would be to expose the postgres port?
2019-05-30 06:18:05	EdwardIII	ilmu: yeah that's right. did you say you were using docker-compose.yml?
2019-05-30 06:18:09	ilmu	yup

2019-05-30 06:39:42	steeznson	docker is similar to a VM in that it runs a "sandbox" around the userspace (which can be very convenient), however it differs from a VM in that the kernel is shared between the host and the docker container. As such there is a docker daemon that is running with root access on the host.
2019-05-30 06:40:45	steeznson	in certain circumstances a malicious attacker could "escape" a docker container and gain access to the docker user which manages the daemon
2019-05-30 06:41:09	steeznson	and in that case they will have acquired root access over the host

2019-05-30 09:16:15	@programmerq	no
2019-05-30 09:16:43	@programmerq	go look for the reference to that special directory I referenced. it's documented in the readme for both mysql and postgres
2019-05-30 09:17:37	eyjhb	Is there some easy payload to "just run", to escape a `--privilege` container?
2019-05-30 09:18:24	iffraff	@programmerq so I see, yes that will load the data in there, but I would like to bake it in an image so that that file is not necessary on every computer.
2019-05-30 09:18:50	@programmerq	iffraff▸ then make an image that is FROM mysql or FROM postgres and then COPY your .sql into that directory
2019-05-30 09:18:58	@programmerq	and then your derivative image has the seed data baked in
2019-05-30 09:19:14	@programmerq	that approach is documented in the readmes for both images

2019-05-30 10:28:25	@programmerq	you can run docker-compose logs -t

2019-05-30 11:23:16	torarne	Q: If I understand things correctly, running a container with --net=host vs the default bridge network means that if the container is compromised, it can pivot to any service running on the host, not just on other hosts in the bridge network. Is this correct(ish)?
2019-05-30 11:24:20	@programmerq	it effectively disables the network isolation features of docker, yes.

2019-05-30 11:25:06	torarne	And in both cases, the container can pivot to other hosts on the network, and the internet effectively, by going out from the docker host network interface?
2019-05-30 11:25:25	@programmerq	by default, containers can egress, yes.
2019-05-30 11:25:37	@programmerq	just like my laptop can egress when connected to my home network.
2019-05-30 11:25:41	torarne	Right
2019-05-30 11:26:58	torarne	Okey, good then my understanding is roughly correct :) Now, the followup question to that is if macvlan effectively gives the pivot-"protection" of the bridge network, while still avoiding the issues with the docker-proxy that result in services like nginx not seeing the real client ip.
2019-05-30 11:27:14	@programmerq	back up
2019-05-30 11:27:25	torarne	:)
2019-05-30 11:27:37	@programmerq	are you using regular containers, or swarm mode?
2019-05-30 11:27:41	torarne	Regular containers
2019-05-30 11:27:59	@programmerq	nginx can see the real client ip when run as a regular container on a bridge network with a published port.

2019-05-30 11:28:37	@programmerq	what ip does it see?
2019-05-30 11:28:50	torarne	The docker interface ip in the container
2019-05-30 11:29:01	torarne	This is an older docker, on a Synology NAS
2019-05-30 11:29:09	torarne	I think it always uses docker-proxy
2019-05-30 11:29:50	torarne	So hairpin NAT and other fancy things that should prevent this situation (from what I've read, but not understood), is not in use

2019-05-30 11:31:25	@programmerq	on my 18.06 ce I can see the actual connecting client ip
2019-05-30 11:31:30	@programmerq	I don't remember what the 17.05 behavior is
2019-05-30 11:32:10	torarne	they are not running dockerd with any options and the config is empty except for a nvidia section
2019-05-30 11:32:13	torarne	so its the default behavior
2019-05-30 11:32:14	@programmerq	I just did 'docker run --name webtest -p 8888:80 -d nginx:alpine' on my host, and then curl <ip>:8888 and 'docker logs webtest' shows my laptop's ip.
2019-05-30 11:32:39	@programmerq	if I do 'curl 127.0.0.1' from the host running docker, then I see the bridge ip
2019-05-30 11:32:43	@programmerq	and that's expected
2019-05-30 11:33:06	@programmerq	and if I curl to the host's ip from the host itself, I see the docker bridge ip
2019-05-30 11:33:17	@programmerq	but if I curl from a different host like my laptop, I see the correct origin ip.
2019-05-30 11:33:32	torarne	let me try just to make sure
2019-05-30 11:33:38	@programmerq	and that makes sense, since the bridge ip is basicaly just the interface on that host that has the route.

2019-05-30 11:47:30	torarne	Is that a correct assumption?

2019-05-30 12:35:38	BtbN	Not without adding extra privs to the container
2019-05-30 12:36:13	BtbN	And I'm not sure if that's desireable and if the rules are even isolates to just that container, or global to the kernel.

The only way i've been able to get it to start is to run 'bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype auto' in Powershell and then restart. Docker then starts for that instance, but it wont' start up again
2019-05-30 13:58:41	njka	because it would take care of specifying AM/PM all the time
2019-05-30 13:58:50	notevil	Yatekii: maybe?  do you need all the data in the current dir to build the image?  if not, put in own directory, and/or look into .dockerignore

2019-05-30 14:02:40	njka	Yatekii: does building the binary have to be part of the container build process?
2019-05-30 14:02:51	njka	( i assume it is, but just asking... )
2019-05-30 14:03:24	Yatekii	njka: not necessarily I have a local toolchain and I assume that anyone has it installed who builds the dockerfile. but I thought it's convenient if you just have to run docker build and be done
2019-05-30 14:03:56	njka	well, it can be... it all depends
2019-05-30 14:04:07	ilmu	okay the entrypoint method has the exact same problem of not finding the file.
2019-05-30 14:04:34	Yatekii	I don't understand what files docker can see and what the filestructure inside looks like
2019-05-30 14:04:47	ilmu	This is really annoying since it can find the Dockerfile, and the Dockerfile stuff is able to do an install so it should be copying everything over since the COPY commands are basically identical
2019-05-30 14:04:51	njka	Yatekii: define "can see"
2019-05-30 14:04:55	njka	or wait
2019-05-30 14:05:01	njka	where's your dockerfile
2019-05-30 14:05:02	Yatekii	because I thought WORKDIR determines the LOCAL workdir from which I copy files INTO the dockerimage from where I then run cargo build.
2019-05-30 14:05:02	ilmu	Yatekii: I am having the exact same problem it seems then

2019-05-30 14:30:54	terror	sqlite is good!
2019-05-30 14:30:55	Yatekii	Unplesantry: why? it's simple.
2019-05-30 14:30:56	greatgatsby	Yatekii, whether sqlite3 is the best to use for whatever you're doing, you can certainly create a volume from a sqlite3 db file, or a directory containing the db
2019-05-30 14:31:10	njka	Yatekii: yeah... bind mount the host dir into the container
2019-05-30 14:31:23	Yatekii	so I have to bind the dir, not the file.
2019-05-30 14:31:25	Yatekii	thx

2019-05-30 14:32:48	Yatekii	thx
2019-05-30 14:32:50	njka	bind mount if you care about any changes persisting...
2019-05-30 14:33:14	zoredache	Not sure it would work for all types of files, depending on how they are used inside a container.  Something that tries to do an atomic save may get a bit confused by a bind mounted file
2019-05-30 14:33:24	greatgatsby	it's not uncommon to mount TLS certs, config files, etc... single files

2019-05-30 14:35:17	greatgatsby	your changes will persist on the file on the host if you bind mount

2019-05-30 14:36:14	greatgatsby	the way you lose your changes is to copy the db to the image using the Dockerfile, do a bunch of stuff only in the container, and then cry when the container stop and you lose everything

2019-05-30 15:41:50	njka	Yatekii: so when you have new code for the same project you should create a new image, copy the new stuff into a new image and then tag it appropriately
2019-05-30 15:42:06	njka	Yatekii: not necessarily
2019-05-30 15:42:26	njka	Yatekii: but in general... containers are meant to be temporary things that don't just run all the time
2019-05-30 15:42:38	Yatekii	yeah the new image part is kinda obvious :P
2019-05-30 15:42:42	Yatekii	okay :)

2019-05-30 15:44:00	Yatekii	and also how I actually deploy the image to my server lol
2019-05-30 15:44:31	Yatekii	oh cool, thanks a lot
2019-05-30 15:44:54	njka	Yatekii: for example, to have a container give you a 'long listing' of a directory you would do something like:
2019-05-30 15:45:07	njka	ENTRYPOINT [ "/bin/ls" ]
2019-05-30 15:45:21	njka	CMD [ "-ls /" ]

2019-05-30 15:45:29	njka	-la
2019-05-30 15:45:49	njka	CMD [ "-la /" ]
2019-05-30 15:46:28	njka	at least that's how i run commands w/args... there might be a batter way to do it

I seem to remember trying to use a base image in a Dockerfile and the modifications I was doing weren't ending up in the resulting image.  Turns out the whole directory was a VOLUME and immutable.  I might be wrong here, that's just how I remember it.
2019-05-30 16:14:31	Unplesantry	if one ship is sailed that means other ships sailed?
2019-05-30 16:14:46	Unplesantry	y even have ships
2019-05-30 16:16:14	terror	iffraff: just point mysql to look for files in another directory outside the volume and you're good to go
2019-05-30 16:16:22	iffraff	postgres actually does the same thing. I use postgres at home.  actualy pg has a startup.sh file that declares the volume.  form my home project I basically copied those two files and removed the volume.

2019-05-30 16:17:19	zoredache	I mean, you could, instead of going from mysql, instead just use adapt the mysql dockerfile maybe?
2019-05-30 16:18:29	iffraff	zoredache: so I did that with postgres and it worked.  (pg does it in the startup.sh) but I just tried in with the mysql dockerfile and while it built just fine, when I inherited itI ddin't get any of the data.

2019-05-30 20:39:01	zoredache	If you are managing a swarm with ansible you might want to look at or possible use this galaxy role https://github.com/thomasjpfan/ansible-docker-swarm-role
2019-05-30 20:39:26	ash_mobile	zoredache, hi, thanks, I got disconnected. Yeah I didn't see them. But I think I got it figured out actually. I guess you use state: present?
2019-05-30 20:39:58	zoredache	From ansible 2.8 there is also the docker_swarm_info, and docker_node_info modules that can use to query the docker host state
2019-05-30 20:39:59	ash_mobile	( to check if the swarm is already been instantiated)
2019-05-30 20:40:17	ash_mobile	Oh neat
2019-05-30 20:40:18	zoredache	ash_mobile: well that would work for the first leader.  It gets complicated when you want to add additional managers/workers
2019-05-30 20:40:21	ash_mobile	Thanks!
2019-05-30 20:41:06	zoredache	that role I mentioned can do most of the complicated work for you for a more complex environment.

2019-05-31 00:46:31	zoredache	maybe, depends on what you are doing.
2019-05-31 00:46:49	zoredache	somethings aren't a great fit for docker. Some things are.

2019-05-31 00:48:31	zoredache	I see. Well I failed my mind reading course at college, so without more details, not sure what else I can add.
2019-05-31 00:48:44	choice	What details do you want?
2019-05-31 00:49:00	choice	I need more details about what details you need. My mind reading isn't that great either :)
2019-05-31 00:50:37	zoredache	Well like I was trying to say. You need to figure out if your software will work well in a container.
2019-05-31 00:51:15	zoredache	if you are using common FOSS style stuff, maybe look on the hub and see if there are existing images for the stuff you run
2019-05-31 00:51:31	choice	It will run in a container. Why wouldn't it?
2019-05-31 00:52:28	zoredache	things that need direct hardware access for gpu usage sometimes don't work well.  Things that do weird things with the network can be difficult
2019-05-31 00:52:37	zoredache	probably lots of other examples.
2019-05-31 00:52:48	choice	It's a web app on top of the typical LAMP stack.
2019-05-31 00:52:57	choice	Works everywhere :)
2019-05-31 00:53:27	choice	My question is if testing in a container while production is in a VM is a good idea.
2019-05-31 00:53:43	choice	I
2019-05-31 00:53:58	choice	I'm not totally sure about the number of differences the application sees then.

2019-05-31 00:54:11	zoredache	why not make both production host and your testing VM be containers
2019-05-31 00:54:38	choice	What would be the benefit? They would still run on different kernels then.

2019-05-31 03:24:56	visual	(that's because the rabbit container stars later, and all the other containers depending on them fail, so have to re-run them again)
2019-05-31 03:25:51	visual	how do i do
2019-05-31 03:25:55	visual	man this is frustrating >:U

2019-05-31 03:29:41	mdbraber	you can check what went wrong e.g. by using 'docker service ps <service-id> --no-trunc'

2019-05-31 03:34:12	pax_rhos	I have an application that runs as N docker containers. how to limit CPU usage so that A. there would be 10% of CPU left for system processes (so all docker containers together could not eat more than 90% CPU) and B. so that, say, if some containers entered some 'MAX CPU consumption' state, nginx container would still have 5% resources?

2019-05-31 03:46:31	BtbN	pax_rhos, specify a custom cgroup parent and set a CPU limit on that.
2019-05-31 03:46:55	pax_rhos	BtbN: isn't that's a solution for A, but not B?
2019-05-31 03:47:03	BtbN	what?
2019-05-31 03:47:38	pax_rhos	> and B. so that, say, if some containers entered some 'MAX CPU consumption' state, nginx container would still have 5% resources?
2019-05-31 03:47:44	BtbN	Only give it 85% then, and a whole other cgroup with 5% just for nginx?
2019-05-31 03:48:12	pax_rhos	so create 2 cgroups for docker containers?
2019-05-31 03:48:54	BtbN	You could probably even create them on top of each other, so you reserve 10% of those 90% for nginx. But no idea if it works that way.
2019-05-31 03:51:06	pax_rhos	thanks, I guess I'll read on cgroups, never used them
2019-05-31 03:51:14	BtbN	Well, docker uses them heavily

2019-05-31 07:53:41	ash_mobile	Yatekii docker enables you to pack an application into an image to aid in deployment, orchestration and parity

2019-05-31 07:54:36	ash_mobile	Yatekii you might want to reconsider your workflow in terms of docker commands
2019-05-31 07:54:45	Yatekii	no.
2019-05-31 07:54:55	ash_mobile	Just a suggestion

2019-05-31 07:56:04	Yatekii	yes, I am not building the image on my server (which I am apprently supposed to do) because that would render docker completely useless. because building it would mean my server needs the build toolchains which is exactly what the dockerfile should bypass

2019-05-31 07:58:04	ash_mobile	I know nothing about your tooling or setup or workflow but a lot of other people in here have tooling, setups, workflows and use docker efficiently. So I don't know
2019-05-31 07:58:07	Yatekii	maybe because the ypush to dockerhub
2019-05-31 07:58:32	ash_mobile	Well, I do not, and it works for me

2019-05-31 09:50:27	cjohnson	Even /tmp which just seems so confusing

2019-05-31 11:36:46	iffraff	Hello.  Does anyone know how to make a preseeded image of mysql?  i.e startup an instance of mysql load a bunch of seed data then convert that to an image which can be used to make many containers later?

2019-05-31 11:37:45	@programmerq	iffraff▸ that's in the readme of the official mysql image. you add your seed data to your derivative image in a specific location in the form of a .sh or a .sql script and the entrypoint will run it on first run and load the seed data.
2019-05-31 11:38:18	@programmerq	you will want the /var/lib/mysql location to be a volume because running a database in the container's write layer is a drag performance wise
2019-05-31 11:38:32	@programmerq	so drop the seed data as the .sql script to be imported on container run

2019-05-31 11:41:09	kalebe	how can I mount a folder a folder where is source is a container
2019-05-31 11:41:12	kalebe	?
2019-05-31 11:41:21	kalebe	not the host fs
2019-05-31 11:42:15	@programmerq	kalebe▸ that's not something that docker offers out of the box. usually if you want both the host and the container to access the same thing, it's a volume which actually resides on the host and gets bind mounted into the container. once mounted, the container can write files to it and the host can see those files.
2019-05-31 11:42:20	@programmerq	but it is indeed not what you're asking for
2019-05-31 11:42:35	@programmerq	you can use 'docker cp' to copy a file out to the host from the container
2019-05-31 11:43:13	kalebe	the mounted folder comes from the host docker image
2019-05-31 11:43:15	@programmerq	or you could do something extra crazy and run some sort of file sharing service inside the container and then mount that out on the host somehow-- would probably need to be some sort of userspace-only file sharing mechanism

2019-05-31 11:43:53	iffraff	@programmerq well, couple things.  one I have found that that doesn't persist the data. so I run another container to do the seeding I start them up with docker=compose and then I docker commit the mysql image.  I thne use that new image as a service in another docker-compose and there's no data in it
2019-05-31 11:44:12	iffraff	I guess that's just one thing

2019-05-31 11:44:28	@programmerq	it is correct that committing a container to a new image won't include data in a volume.
2019-05-31 11:44:37	@programmerq	I wouldn't recommend using docker commit as part of any workflow anyway
2019-05-31 11:45:08	iffraff	ok cool  so how would it work?
2019-05-31 11:45:15	@programmerq	there's only two usecases that I would say you should use 'docker commit' -- the first is a learning tool to understand how the image layering system works
2019-05-31 11:45:23	@programmerq	the second is if you're implementing your own build tool
2019-05-31 11:45:33	@programmerq	but other than that, don't use 'docker commit'-- use a Dockerfile instead
2019-05-31 11:45:44	iffraff	just take the image that is generated by the docker compose and use it in another docker compose?
2019-05-31 11:45:51	@programmerq	your derivative image where you ADD or COPY in the initial .sql data is how that initial seeded data will get into the image
2019-05-31 11:46:05	@programmerq	so you'd generate that .sql file with mysqldump or similar
2019-05-31 11:46:30	@programmerq	you can build and push an image, yes
2019-05-31 11:46:38	@programmerq	and then that image can be pulled by those who want to use it
2019-05-31 11:46:47	@programmerq	and that's true whether you've got docker-compose in the equation or not.
2019-05-31 11:46:59	iffraff	ok, so create a Dockerfile that inherits from mysql:whatever and then add the like ADD mypath/sqlfile.sql .  then run that?
2019-05-31 11:47:25	@programmerq	depending on what . is
2019-05-31 11:47:27	kalebe	programmerq: i thought about that... the cleaner solution I was able to implement was to reference a volume name on the folder i want to share on the source container, then docker will automacticaly copy data from the image to the volume, if the volume is new, then mount on the destination container... problem with that is that once I update the image, It wont copy the updated data, once the volume already
2019-05-31 11:47:33	kalebe	has files on it
2019-05-31 11:47:34	@programmerq	the mysql page on docker hub has the correct location documented.

2019-05-31 11:48:19	@programmerq	kalebe▸ that is correct. you'd need to delete the volume to get the copy to happen again. that's probably not a bad thing. alternatively, you could

2019-05-31 11:48:35	@programmerq	have an entrypoint script that will copy something from one place in the container over to the volume location
2019-05-31 11:48:50	kalebe	programmerq: there lies to problem... I have to remove the volume every time I update the image...
2019-05-31 11:48:54	@programmerq	and that entrypoint script could do it whether it's a new/empty volume or not
2019-05-31 11:49:13	iffraff	kalebe: that might work perhaps you could have your data in directory /path/master and copy it to /path/volume then use the /path/volume to mount to. when you wnat it clean again you just copy master over to volume
2019-05-31 11:49:38	@programmerq	but at the end of the day, docker isn't really designed to be a distribution mechanism for stuff that isn't supposed to be in a container? why not just check out these files on the host from git? I guess I don't know what your context is and what problem you're trying to solve.

2019-05-31 11:57:12	@programmerq	iffraff▸ if you stop a mysql server, you can indeed copy its /var/lib/mysql directory over to another place and then start two mysql databases with a copy of the same data, yes
2019-05-31 11:57:43	@programmerq	and since a docker volume is just a way to present a directory to the containerized process, it doesn't really change that
2019-05-31 11:57:50	@programmerq	you can copy files and you can start processes.
2019-05-31 11:58:26	@programmerq	but copying a "hot" /var/lib/mysql database can result in consistency issues, so stop mysql cleanly and you're good.
2019-05-31 11:58:42	@programmerq	or you could just do the mysqldump and drop in the .sh into your new image

2019-05-31 12:26:08	iffraff	@programmerq seems that when I startup the mysql container pointing to the same volume as the other one was pointing, it over writes the data with a new db since it's start new.

2019-05-31 12:34:25	iffraff	@programmerq when you declare a volumn in docker-compose, is that volume bound by the namespace of the docker-compose or just the name you assigned it.
2019-05-31 12:34:47	@programmerq	docker-compose will pop in the project name to volumes
2019-05-31 12:34:55	@programmerq	but you can override it

2019-05-31 12:35:12	@programmerq	(I think)
2019-05-31 12:35:28	@programmerq	if you declare it as an external volume, then docker-compose will just use an existing volume, but won't create it for you if it doesn't exist.

2019-06-01 05:20:08	senaps	https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/JnQdzY5mQP/ this is my dockerfile, it works okay. my problem is the requirements file should download some local repos(on a server on 192.168.0.118), now i think it's the docker networking thing that wont allow the image to see that 192.168.0.118 machine. how can i allow this docker to be able to see that?

2019-06-01 05:53:00	greatgatsby	senaps, if your docker host can talk to that machine, your running container should be able to as well, it's just NAT by default.  What happens if you `docker run -it python:3.6 bash` and try to ping that machine?

2019-06-01 16:51:32	nacelle	miscapples: have you tried Docker?
2019-06-01 16:51:36	nacelle	its free...
2019-06-01 16:56:36	tabakhase	"container-break-out" is a somewhat special storry... iirc docker claims nowhere to be some battle hardened sandbox you can use to try out the newest word.doc.zip.exe you got by mail...
2019-06-01 16:58:07	tabakhase	and for most cases, "one needs to breach the thing runing there first, and then also breach docker" compared to "only has to breach the thing" as a dedicated server would be like ((think of some rpc to give you a shell in apache as example)
2019-06-01 16:58:56	jrabbit	you aren't required to use docker in production if you use it elsewhere
2019-06-01 16:59:11	jrabbit	it just makes the most sense and has a bigger utility

2019-06-01 17:01:49	tabakhase	that too^^ - there is a loong way to go on docker between "use docker in your CI to run some analyzer" - where its fantastic tooling! ||| and "people building superbly broken all-in-one images with wordpress,apache,mysql, throw that into ECS/AWS and assume thats "good" - and actually "dockerized" applications that actually live in the ecosystem, in k8s and whatanots that can be hundrets of

2019-06-01 17:05:20	jrabbit	docker should like warn you if you try and install supervisord, systemd, pm2

2019-06-01 17:06:43	tabakhase	yes ;D -- but as much as thats true, i gotta admit that starting with phusion baseimage thingy with runit and a few examples took a lot of guesswork out of the first steps when porting in legacy things... - never for prod, but for dev, better than no dev and working on prod via FTP hm ;-)
2019-06-01 17:06:49	njka	jrabbit: not sure
2019-06-01 17:07:02	njka	tabakhase: yes, it did
2019-06-01 17:07:45	njka	i think phusion/baseimage is secretly meant to discourage init systems in containers after one figures out what docker was meant to do :)
2019-06-01 17:08:02	njka	i cut my teeth on phusion
2019-06-01 17:08:14	jrabbit	the problem is in my experince is you can't get a heuristic without knowing the app and it's imags

2019-06-01 19:00:48	LACampbell	idk, maybe
2019-06-01 19:00:55	njka	LACampbell: well... your docker installation is most likely fucked

2019-06-01 19:18:44	LACampbell	I feel like I have some basics. have two docker files, and I compose them, and that all seems to work well
2019-06-01 19:19:09	LACampbell	the bits I am struggling with are environmental vars. and just general sucking at sanity when deploying

2019-06-01 19:29:33	miscapples	I wish Docker worked like this: 1. I install it on Windows. 2. I run it and it shows a wizard called "New container". 3. I get to do a multi-step, checkbox-filled little setup process which soon produces MyApp.container. I can then upload that single file to a rich variety of companies all over the world, and after I start giving them money, they put it into their "cloud". They cannot peak into it because it's securely encrypted and their supervisor
2019-06-01 19:29:33	miscapples	program doesn't ever "unlock" it either because all of the actual data is fully encapsulated deep inside this blob. And the only one who can change it is me because I have the .privatkey file that Docker saved as I created the container.

2019-06-02 01:03:58	cedra	I just recreated it with the bridge defaults to see if that works
2019-06-02 01:04:10	cim209	does it stay up?

2019-06-02 01:07:56	cim209	that's because in the example from their hub, it doesn't map any port
2019-06-02 01:08:10	cim209	there is an example for bridge networking with port mapping
2019-06-02 01:08:33	cedra	yes but host mode should work as well
2019-06-02 01:08:38	cim209	yeah idk
2019-06-02 01:08:40	cedra	regardless, bridge networking gives me the same thing

2019-06-02 01:40:57	cim209	docker usually uses local images first, if not found, then it will download it from the registry

2019-06-02 01:45:32	cim209	did you do docker load < image.tgz?

2019-06-02 01:53:24	holgersson	Hi everyone, is there a git:// or ssh:// syntax to tell docker or docker-compose to fetch stuff automaticly from a specified git repo? If not I write a shell wrapper myself, but it would be nice as a builtin feature.
2019-06-02 01:56:02	john_89	yes I build the image on another machine, so I load the image and then docker will know for this new image? And then I use the same tag in docker-compose.yml
2019-06-02 01:57:36	cim209	john_89: if it's not in the registry then read this https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/save/

(also expose is for "in", for "out" you dont need any ports at all) -- "simplest" would prob be to run it in the "host" network namespace... but its rly more a "not do final delivery from docker" ((as "outgoing ip" may be whatever.. and you likely have a static one with reputaton on your mailserver - or use smth like sendgrid/mailjet and whatanot...)

2019-09-17 18:48:52	cim209	jesus that's a lot of mounting of docker.sock
2019-09-17 18:49:03	cim209	with traefik, you just mount it once
2019-09-17 18:49:25	mxiia	i should really try traefik
2019-09-17 18:49:37	mxiia	any suggested guides?
2019-09-17 18:49:58	mxiia	that will still match my config of having letsencrypts generated per subdomain?
2019-09-17 18:50:03	cim209	i would recommend using version 1.x for now
2019-09-17 18:50:14	mxiia	fair enough, I saw 2.0 came out today
2019-09-17 18:50:31	cim209	traefik stores all LE certs in one json file
2019-09-17 18:50:37	cim209	acme.json
2019-09-17 18:50:45	mxiia	dumb question, but I'll be able to use my existing volumes if i switch to traefik
2019-09-17 18:50:55	mxiia	should I use traefik as a docker container or standalone?
2019-09-17 18:51:12	cim209	i use it as a docker container
2019-09-17 18:51:15	mxiia	I also thought about using the host's nginx as a reverse proxy
2019-09-17 18:51:20	cim209	all my services runs in docker only
2019-09-17 18:51:41	cim209	i don't wanna pollute the host OS with useless libraries
2019-09-17 18:51:48	mxiia	is it the same environment variables to pass through?
2019-09-17 18:51:50	mxiia	good point
2019-09-17 18:52:08	cim209	traefik uses labels
2019-09-17 18:52:09	mxiia	or is their github populated with all the variables I need
2019-09-17 18:52:22	cim209	look at their docs
2019-09-17 18:52:28	mxiia	fair enough
2019-09-17 18:52:30	mxiia	will do
2019-09-17 18:52:42	> 	tm (~sinnlos@unaffiliated/tm) has joined #docker
2019-09-17 18:52:55	mxiia	I assume I can point to port and container ip/name?
2019-09-17 18:53:06	cim209	i feel like the jwilder nginx proxy is a hack to make it work with docker
2019-09-17 18:53:20	cim209	where as traefik natively works with docker
2019-09-17 18:53:39	> 	a0s510 (~a0s510@2601:643:8500:5487:6deb:e020:a246:7d26) has joined #docker
2019-09-17 18:53:40	mxiia	that makes a lot of sense
2019-09-17 18:53:49	mxiia	I've been digging trying to find why my ghost doesn't work
2019-09-17 18:53:55	tabakhase	id sign that...
2019-09-17 18:53:56	mxiia	cause i'm passing the right ports and all that
2019-09-17 18:54:03	mxiia	so i should just use a proper tool
2019-09-17 18:54:17	mxiia	and ghost works when I run it by itself with 80:2368
2019-09-17 18:54:21	cim209	when you configure traefik, make sure expose by default is set to false
2019-09-17 18:54:36	mxiia	can you elaborate on that?
2019-09-17 18:54:51	mxiia	and last question, can I make traefik redirect like say www.example.com to example.com
2019-09-17 18:54:56	cim209	otherwise traefik will request LE certs for all containers and you'll hit request limit
2019-09-17 18:54:58	mxiia	or multiple subdomains per host?
2019-09-17 18:55:15	cim209	mxiia: yes
2019-09-17 18:55:25	mxiia	so that default would apply unless a container says it wants to be exposed
2019-09-17 18:55:34	cim209	correct
2019-09-17 18:56:23	mxiia	cool
2019-09-17 18:56:37	mxiia	i'll be messing around with traefik tomorrow
2019-09-17 18:56:40	mxiia	thanks for your help

2019-09-18 01:15:58	escherial	hey, so if you bind a directory from the host in the container it'll override the container's existing contents, correct? what happens if you bind a directory from the host into the container, then create a volume inside of that directory? (i'm asking because my coworker's config had something like that and i don't quite get how it works)
2019-09-18 01:16:34	escherial	for example, in docker-compose under 'volumes', they first had ./some_dir:/local_dir, then ./some_dir/node_modules

I'm making a singular request.  This container is built from a Dockerfile and the Go code runs without issue outside of the container.  Anyone have any ideas or advice?
2019-09-18 01:17:04	escherial	(i presume that was to allow node_modules to be included from the container instead of from the host, so that it wouldn't be shadowed by the host's empty node_modules folder)

2019-09-18 01:20:29	escherial	eyJhb: sorry, i phrased that wrong; i did try it and it does "work" (i mean, the contents of node_modules are apparently populated from the container), but i don't get why

2019-09-18 01:25:02	Ploppz	I'm trying to run my application (written in Rust) in one container, alongside another container that runs `minio` which exposes aws S3 endpoint on `localhost:9000`. docker-compose file: https://bpaste.net/show/KaS3 . My problem is that the application (tests) cannot connect to localhost:9000 in this configuration. However, if I run `cargo test
2019-09-18 01:25:03	Ploppz	...` in the host OS and run the minio container with `docker run` it works fine. Is there anything I should know about docker-compose that could explain why one container cannot connect to a port of the other?
2019-09-18 01:25:03	eyJhb	Or in general, not do that at all

2019-09-18 01:39:49	Ploppz	or is this the wrong approach if I want services to reach each other through `127.0.0.1`?

2019-09-18 01:40:43	cisowithshells	(And when running a privileged container is it necessary to use --pid/--network/--ipc/--uts host on it?)
2019-09-18 01:40:59	Ploppz	I mean docker-compose does not complain; it's just that one service cannot access the other through 127.0.0.1
2019-09-18 01:42:00	cim209	Ploppz: mine looks like this https://kopy.io/TWwlL
2019-09-18 01:43:38	escherial	eyJhb: how else would you do it, out of curiosity? the natural solution to me would be to have the bound directory be totally separate, but i guess that's not always an option (e.g. in this case, where the outer code expects node_modules to be in there, but i want to avoid installing it redundantly on the host)
2019-09-18 01:44:31	Ploppz	thank you cim209 . With a similar configuration and version 3.7 it still does not work. Maybe it's due to something else than docker then..
2019-09-18 01:44:58	cim209	strange, i could ping my db container inside another container
2019-09-18 01:45:04	Ckat	is there a somewhat standard way to use secrets in containers that only want environment values as passwords?
2019-09-18 01:45:18	cim209	Ploppz: instead of 127.0.0.1, use the service name
2019-09-18 01:45:21	Ckat	I'm seeing some questionable solutions where they set them from the entry script

When I launch this command “docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -e VAR1=... -e VAR2=... .myimage”, if I reboot my host (not the container), the container restarts automatically after the boot. Where are stored in the filesystem of my host the information that my container has to restart automatically at boot, and where are stored my env variables settings (the -e options)?

2019-09-18 05:46:42	@L0j1k	mikejw: there's a difference between bash as your login/interactive shell and invoked bash scripts. i'm not willing to absolve docker-machine of culpability, but have you rtfm'd bash? i was just looking at this tonight haha
2019-09-18 05:47:25	@L0j1k	e.g. if you `echo ${0}` you'll get '-bash' in your login/interactive shell, with the prefix -
2019-09-18 05:47:31	@L0j1k	but in shell scripts you won't
2019-09-18 05:48:25	@L0j1k	of course, all this changes if you are using an oldbash on OSX

I'm making a singular request.  This container is built from a Dockerfile and the Go code runs without issue outside of the container.  Anyone have any ideas or advice?

2019-09-18 08:16:33	vegardx	When you scale up enough you stop maintaining machines as pets, but rather cattle. If that means docker containers or machine images you still have to do it. And it takes less time when you have more than 10 machines doing the same.
2019-09-18 08:16:40	vegardx	Also nice when you have to rebuild things.
2019-09-18 08:16:55	BtbN	All the dependend libraries are in there, an entire other package manager, completely decoupled from the actual OS.

2019-09-18 08:18:34	tabakhase	imagequallity is rly key there yea... - and "docker sits kinda downstream" yes as "a lot" of images use apt and whatanot, so yea for a new nginx image that you build with apt debian guys need to do there job first :P --- but likely the "nginx" library image is not using apt, but builds it from source

2019-09-18 10:07:08	@programmerq	use an entrypoint script. you can pass in an entrypoint script at runtime via a bind mount and the --entrypoint argument to 'docker run'
2019-09-18 10:07:29	@programmerq	or you can create a new Dockerfile and ADD the entrypoint script and set the ENTRYPOINT/CMD directive as you see fit.

2019-09-18 10:08:29	@programmerq	when you have an entrypoint involved, that's the command that docker runs, and passes the command as an argument to the entrypoint

2019-09-18 10:08:46	@programmerq	so the pattern is to usually have your entrypoint script call: exec "$@"

2019-09-18 10:09:05	@programmerq	so you can do your work above there, and then it executes the command that docker passes to it as an argument.

2019-09-18 13:38:24	etraga	And can I inverse the scheme: manage iptables my self, and just add some basic rules for docker?
2019-09-18 13:38:55	@ada_	there isn't one
2019-09-18 13:39:18	@ada_	long answer:  I can't really tell you how to manually create all the necessary iptables rules to make container networking work correctly
2019-09-18 13:39:20	@ada_	there is a LOT of them
2019-09-18 13:39:31	@ada_	it could be done but would be a gigantic hassle
2019-09-18 13:39:56	@ada_	you have to also create lots of rules inside the containers themselves, as well

2019-09-18 13:41:10	etraga	I'll try... No risk to lock my ssh access if I reset all rules to default and restart docker?

2019-09-18 13:41:45	@ada_	it is possible
2019-09-18 13:41:48	@programmerq	the iptables=false option that docker has is kind of "broken" anyway-- there are cetain things that docker will ignore that and still write out rules. imo, it should just be removed from docker since it doesn't do anything really useful other than break everything.
2019-09-18 13:41:55	@ada_	agree ^
2019-09-18 13:42:01	@ada_	it's confusing at best

2019-09-18 15:58:19	@programmerq	Swahili▸ most folks that do production environments will use a more general purpose tool to provision aws resources. docker-machine is in maintenance mode and most of its users tend to use it for temporary/dev workflows only.

2019-09-18 15:59:21	@programmerq	at the end of the day though, whatever calls your aws api and creates the ec2 instance isn't really a big deal. docker-machine just lacks in features-- it doesn't talk to any of the fancy aws features-- it can't do an ELB, it isn't super flexible with the networking setup.
2019-09-18 15:59:34	@programmerq	so if it happens to fit your requirements for your production needs, then sure.
2019-09-18 15:59:38	@programmerq	but it isn't my first choice.

2019-09-18 16:00:57	Swahili	programmerq: Thanks for looking! Ok, that means that is best to do my delivery pipeline strategy using the aws cli api, etc? I've actually been learning Traefik as you suggested and it's been great, very happy with it, even though the documentation is not great but I don't want to sound rude, as in a very humble way it's great tech and I can only dream of doing something like that.
2019-09-18 16:01:28	@programmerq	you don't *have* to use any one particular api client
2019-09-18 16:01:34	@programmerq	there are lots of them. terraform is pretty popular
2019-09-18 16:01:43	Swahili	but even the thought of using it in aws, makes me wonder how ELB would work if I'm using Traefik. Because I guess that'd be ALB or ELB > Traefik > MyServices
2019-09-18 16:02:07	@programmerq	ELB is useful for balancing the nodes on your swarm
2019-09-18 16:02:30	@programmerq	traefik is handy for dynamic layer 7 namevhost type stuff
2019-09-18 16:02:34	@programmerq	different concerns
2019-09-18 16:02:40	@programmerq	so it's common to have both
2019-09-18 16:02:44	Swahili	programmerq: regarding the api clients like terraform, I think I'll use the aws UI to start with and then try to write my deployment strategy through the aws api.
2019-09-18 16:03:19	Swahili	programmerq: ok, so if I'm asked how ELB will work with Traefik, I don't need to stress about it and it should work still right?
2019-09-18 16:04:03	@programmerq	yeah, configure the ELB to do tcp port 80 and 443 in to your traefik http and https ports
2019-09-18 16:04:07	Swahili	I'm not really a devops but just doing this job because the ops guy didn't do anything for 4 months and I can't publish my work and I asked to do this, so been doing my best. and from tomorrow I'll start with the pipeline, at least as a proof of concept.
2019-09-18 16:04:13	@programmerq	put all your swarm nodes in the elb group
2019-09-18 16:04:41	Swahili	programmerq: I was asked to use ECS instead
2019-09-18 16:05:05	Swahili	I also haven't learned swarm yet, if it's best I guess I can take the time
2019-09-18 16:07:09	Swahili	how does SSL certificates work if its managed by ALB and I have docker + traefik, I wonder how that is

2019-09-18 17:04:51	@programmerq	that's outside the normal workflow/best practice of a docker container. it's still possible to do it, but it's not going to be easy/clean/suitable for long term.
2019-09-18 17:05:22	jimender2	Do you have any other suggestions for how to get them remote access?
2019-09-18 17:05:24	@programmerq	a docker container workflow is best compared to a regular service. nginx is in a container, apache would be in its own container, etc.
2019-09-18 17:05:40	Swahili	jimender2: `docker exec -it serviceName bash`, but programmerq is right
2019-09-18 17:05:56	@programmerq	my quick answer is that the docker toolset isn't best suited for your usecase-- you want something that works more like a regular virtual machine, right?
2019-09-18 17:06:20	@programmerq	lxc or openvz are container technologies that treat that sort of workflow as more of a first class citizen
2019-09-18 17:06:37	jimender2	that would be best I guess. I  was looking at wetty and some people said that docker would run wetty
2019-09-18 17:07:18	@programmerq	but you could certainly get a docker image set up that you put on a custom docker networking driver (non-default), that has some sort of process manager (ubuntu runs systemd by default, and systemd doesn't play nicely in a container since it's built around a process structure and not a systemd structure, and you'd have to enable --privileged to get systemd fully working in it)
2019-09-18 17:07:49	@programmerq	and then you could run ssh or whatever else you need on top of that process manager in a customized image on a customized network
