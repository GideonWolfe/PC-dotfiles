2019-06-18 22:37:23	_Raijin	Hello, is there a way I can use the gnuplot config file to set the default line style? I would like to set defined colors without having to explicitly call linestyle while plotting

2019-06-18 23:47:08	jayne	_Raijin: sure. "help set style increment" has an example.
2019-06-18 23:47:31	jayne	or I guess that's been replaced with "set linetype" now
2019-06-19 00:46:56	_Raijin	jayne: https://github.com/GideonWolfe/Gnuplot-Pywal I am working on this. It should be fully working soon!
2019-06-19 00:50:48	jayne	hmm. never heard of pywal before now.
2019-06-19 01:06:31	xrogaan	_Raijin: I've read this recently http://www.gnuplotting.org/ease-your-plotting-with-config-snippets/
