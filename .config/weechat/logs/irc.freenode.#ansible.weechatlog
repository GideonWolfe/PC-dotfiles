2019-07-05 12:24:43	Sketch	maybe someone knows a simple way to do this... i want to find which interface in ansible_interfaces has 2 specific attributes
2019-07-05 12:25:14	lijok	selectattr() ?
2019-07-05 12:26:35	Sketch	yeah, that will probably work
2019-07-05 12:26:58	*	Sketch wonders why interfaces are listed as top-level facts and not as sub-items of ansible_interfaces 
2019-07-05 12:27:33	Sketch	i guess i don't have to care which things are interfaces, since those two items will never match anything else
2019-07-05 12:27:57	lijok	tell me about it, i've been strugling with that
2019-07-05 12:28:03	Sketch	hopefully, anyway ;)
2019-07-05 12:28:26	Sketch	type: ether should be pretty specific...
2019-07-05 12:28:40	lijok	# this enumerates available interfaces and their facts_all_interfaces: "{{  ansible_facts  | dict2items  | selectattr('value.macaddress', 'defined')  | selectattr('key', 'ne', 'default_ipv4')  | selectattr('key', 'ne', 'default_ipv6')  | list }}"# using _all_interfaces we extract the interface facts# whose mac addresses match the ones we assigned#
2019-07-05 12:28:40	lijok	in platform['networks']_interfaces:  lan: "{{ _all_interfaces | selectattr('value.macaddress', 'eq', '70:72:63' | random_mac(seed=inventory_hostname)) | list | first }}"

2019-07-05 18:39:46	kiwiirc	playbooks/main.yaml references playbooks/playbook.yaml which references a role which has a meta reference to another role which cant resolve a global handler unless the global handlers block is in playbooks/main.yaml in addition to playbooks/playbook.yaml needed for the first role to resolve handlers
2019-07-05 18:40:05	kiwiirc	id think any roles that a role brings in would have access to same handlers

2019-07-05 18:42:41	kiwiirc	what do you want me to call it? the play handler?
2019-07-05 18:42:47	agaffney	there shouldn't be any practical difference
2019-07-05 18:43:03	kiwiirc	there are 2 different ones so im being more specific to communicate which one is the issue
2019-07-05 18:44:02	kiwiirc	i think youre getting lost in weeds and missing the big picture
2019-07-05 18:44:28	kiwiirc	adding the handlers block back to the top level playbook shouldn't fix the problem but it does so i wanna understand it better
2019-07-05 18:45:17	agaffney	which problem are you talking about?
2019-07-05 18:45:41	agaffney	if a role handler is needed in multiple plays, that role needs to be used in each play separately
2019-07-05 18:47:04	kiwiirc	there is only 1 play im talking about, the one from playbooks.yaml. it includes a role and that role has a meta (not shown in isolated case) that includes another role, role2
2019-07-05 18:47:20	kiwiirc	there's no play other than the one including role, that's including role2
2019-07-05 18:50:41	agaffney	your main.yml contained a play and then an include for playbook.yml
2019-07-05 18:51:10	kiwiirc	and?

2019-07-05 23:29:30	zoredache	that is a single task, the app_dir needs to be evaluated before the task runs

2019-07-05 23:40:00	zoredache	are you doing serial or do you have forks set maybe?

2019-07-06 07:16:48	agaffney	no, filters only have access to what is passed to them
2019-07-06 07:18:33	is_null	thanks agaffney ! i was looking to do a little esthetics job, perhaps you know another way ? Trying to change, in vars/main.yml, things like : acme: '{{ ansible_facts.ansible_local.get("yourlabs_traefik", {}).get("acme", "staging<-mydefault") }}'
2019-07-06 07:18:47	is_null	with something at least a bit more readable like : acme: '{{ "yourlabs_traefik"|remember("acme", "staging") }}'
2019-07-06 07:19:12	is_null	so that was a great idea until tried to get ansible_facts from the template filter xD
2019-07-06 07:19:54	is_null	i mean i can live with it, but everything else i had to do is really so perfect that i'm happy to spend a couple of hours trying to improve that
2019-07-06 07:20:43	is_null	might show you after if you're looking for brainfood, it's some simple patterns i've been iterating over and over again on for the last couple of years ;)

2019-07-06 07:22:59	is_null	maybe it would work to just have these in defaults rather and have an inventory plugin and ship it in my little experimental role, will try that, if anybody comes up with an idea i'm all ears !
2019-07-06 07:26:12	agaffney	is_null: as of ansible 2.8, you don't need to use tricks like the chained .get() calls. the |default() filter will work for deep structures where not all levels may exist
2019-07-06 07:26:44	is_null	that's really good to know, thank you deeply

2019-07-06 11:54:53	drybjed	for example if you have a firewall daemon, you could script it to read the list of ports periodically from the tinydb managed via a fact

2019-07-06 11:54:57	is_null	after role A changes a firewall-related fact it could include the firewall role, because all other roles would already have put the config they need in the facts
2019-07-06 11:55:21	is_null	nice
2019-07-06 11:55:24	drybjed	perhaps firewall is too simple an use case for it, but something more complex could use this mechanism better
2019-07-06 11:56:02	drybjed	is_null: actually, almost all of my roles have their own facts, and outside of passing data to some roles I haven't found a good use case for them yet

2019-07-06 11:57:13	is_null	i think that should work because the firewall role could iterate over ansible_facts.ansible_local.items()
2019-07-06 11:58:09	drybjed	not necessairly - the firewall role would have to know the structure of each fact, or you would have to define a rigid structure which exposes the port fact in a known way, which might be not ideal

Seems many in community still do test kitchen, inspec etc. What are the drawbacks to molecule/testinfra etc. I know that's the recommended/official route, but is it mature? lacking much? Would be nice for some to compare all the options and comment on a blog or something. Any feedback here is appreciated.

2019-07-06 16:43:08	_falsebay_	I'm working on trying to implement a linter for requirements.yml. We have a new requirement that internal common role repos not point at master/HEAD.
2019-07-06 16:43:14	_falsebay_	I've been looking at writing a custom rule for ansible-lint, but I'm not sure that's the best way to go. I can't find anything to suggest that I would be able to lint requirements.yml using the existing AnsibleLintRule class methods: matchtask, match as they are meant for playbooks.
2019-07-06 16:43:33	_falsebay_	Does anyone have any suggestions for the direction I should go with this?

2019-07-06 19:34:57	is_null	hi all, is there a variable with the screen width ? i notice that ansible always knows the right screen size
2019-07-06 19:35:32	is_null	i suppose i can use a template filter as a hack to get it nevermind
2019-07-06 19:38:23	agaffney	the terminal width is handled within the callback plugin and it not exposed as a var
2019-07-06 19:40:02	is_null	is there not a module to execute raw python code ? with evil()
2019-07-06 19:40:45	agaffney	no, but you could write a plugin to do the specific work you need
2019-07-06 19:40:52	is_null	a template filter even, could use things like {{ "import os; os.get_terminal_size()"|python }}
2019-07-06 19:41:51	is_null	yep, and i see that there's a whole lot new types of plugins that didn't exist a couple of years back, nice work ;)
2019-07-06 19:43:33	is_null	i don't remember making an Action plugin ever, the man page is sparse but somehow it looks pretty powerful

2019-07-06 21:29:32	is_null	is it the yaml that's on the first script of the paste that's causing problem ? https://gist.github.com/ITblacksheep/21505d1c42b2e7434958914cc15b0ee9
2019-07-06 21:29:38	blacksheepit	yeah
2019-07-06 21:29:41	is_null	yeah i just saw sorry i was eating while you posted
2019-07-06 21:29:50	blacksheepit	its line 18
2019-07-06 21:30:37	is_null	are you sure you can mix JSON in YAML like this ?
2019-07-06 21:30:48	is_null	no wonder the YAML parser doesn't survive this
2019-07-06 21:31:06	blacksheepit	yeah with cisco ucs managed objects module that is the only way it works
2019-07-06 21:31:19	blacksheepit	you don't want to see the rest of the code
2019-07-06 21:31:22	is_null	tried pasting your code in this ? http://www.yamllint.com/

2019-07-06 21:33:25	is_null	but then put it in a literal because you can see that it's interpreted as a yaml dict
2019-07-06 21:34:03	is_null	it's not interpreted as a JSON string
2019-07-06 21:34:26	is_null	because in YAML, `- {` is a list item that contains a dict

2019-07-07 06:15:01	jhujhiti	nope, the loop is trying to evaluate the failed_when condition, but the lacp_status variable was not registered because the previous task was skipped

2019-07-07 06:23:24	jhujhiti	if the when were being evaluated before failed_when, i would think that we would skip the task and therefore the evaluation of failed_when, whether inside the loop or outside of it

2019-07-07 06:37:28	agaffney	jhujhiti: that error is coming from the 'subelements' filter in the 'loop' value. the 'loop' value is *always* evaluated, so you need to protect it against cases like this
2019-07-07 06:37:33	jhujhiti	ah, it's probably the loop where it fails

2019-07-07 06:39:40	Xalys	Should the primary vars file in group_vars and host_vars be called 'main.yml' or 'vars.yml' ?
2019-07-07 06:39:43	Xalys	Docs aren't clear
2019-07-07 06:39:59	jhujhiti	just to confirm i understand -- since the register is always run, it's safe to dereference lacp_status?
2019-07-07 06:40:38	agaffney	Xalys: there's no such thing as a "primary vars file" in group/host_vars
2019-07-07 06:40:39	agaffney	jhujhiti: yes
2019-07-07 06:40:40	kapsh	Xalys, what is primary file? You need to name files as related groups.
2019-07-07 06:40:43	jhujhiti	same error with that if condition. that's the code i was thinking of too to protect against this
2019-07-07 06:41:58	agaffney	jhujhiti: try `loop: "{{ lacp_status.resource | subelements('proto') if lacp_status is not skipped else [] }}"`
2019-07-07 06:42:25	agaffney	it's possible that that module still defines the 'resource' attribute even when the task is skipped
2019-07-07 06:43:10	agaffney	Xalys: files in host_vars and group_vars are picked up based on host/group names. if you use dirs under there, all files under the matching dir will be evaluated
2019-07-07 06:44:25	Xalys	agaffney: my structure is group_vars/<groupname>/xxxx.yml
2019-07-07 06:44:57	Xalys	Each group_vars/<groupname> dir has at least 1 vars file, and I want to know if there's a best practice to name the first main file (with generic host settings in my case) main.yml or vars.yml
2019-07-07 06:47:06	agaffney	Xalys: as I just said above, all files under the matching dir will be evaluated
2019-07-07 06:47:27	flowerysong	Do you find that to be a useful name? Then use it. The only important part of the name in this case is the directory.
2019-07-07 06:48:27	Xalys	agaffney: my questionis: "I want to know if there's a best practice". A yes/no will do
2019-07-07 06:48:38	agaffney	there is not, because it does not matter
2019-07-07 06:48:43	Xalys	Thank you
2019-07-07 06:49:04	agaffney	the "no" was implied in my previous answers
2019-07-07 06:49:30	jhujhiti	agaffney: nope, but we're close. i also tried "if not lacp_status.skipped" because an unconditional debug shows lacp_status defined with a key skipped set to true
2019-07-07 06:49:41	jhujhiti	quite surprised that the latter didn't work
2019-07-07 06:50:01	agaffney	jhujhiti: that's what the 'is skipped' test checks, and it also accounts for the 'skipped' attribute not existing
2019-07-07 06:50:16	jhujhiti	ah
2019-07-07 06:50:36	agaffney	that really should work
2019-07-07 06:51:40	jhujhiti	oh, so this is interesting. if i replace the entire looped task with a debug msg="hello" and a when of just "lacp_status.skipped", it runs
2019-07-07 06:52:08	jhujhiti	jinja evaluation ordering problem maybe?
2019-07-07 06:55:13	jhujhiti	oh, oh, i've done something stupid
2019-07-07 06:57:15	JEEB	)45
2019-07-07 06:58:02	jhujhiti	agaffney: yep, your initial suggestion with lacp_status.skipped in it works. thanks! i forgot to move the }} to the end of the condition so it was still being evaluated without the conditional :(
2019-07-07 06:58:17	kapsh	Xalys, I'd say choose main.yml as it widely used in roles and will be less confusing for others who read your playbooks.

2019-07-08 01:37:08	Xalys	Hi. I have a strange issue. I have a playbook where I conditionally include a role. The host I'm running the playbook on does not match the condition, so the task shouldn't run. The task doesn't run, almost -- it skips each task except a copy task with_first_found. Why does it not skip this specific task but does skip all others?

2019-07-08 04:02:17	maeud	I've just upgraded from 2.5 to 2.8.1, when creating an immutable file with 'touch', I get an error that it is not permitted, the file doesn't exist before the playbook tries to create it
2019-07-08 04:02:19	Kim^J	maeud: What's the bug?
2019-07-08 04:02:27	maeud	check the pastebin Kim^J
2019-07-08 04:02:47	Kim^J	Well, do you run it as root?

2019-07-08 04:02:53	maeud	It looks like the file is being created with the immutable attribute, then Ansible is trying to run touch on it
2019-07-08 04:02:57	maeud	Yes running as root
2019-07-08 04:03:19	maeud	no issues before upgrading
2019-07-08 04:04:13	maeud	"msg": "Error while updating modification or access time: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted: '/root/immutable_file'",
2019-07-08 04:04:21	maeud	that's what I would expect to see after the file has been created
2019-07-08 04:04:45	Kim^J	maeud: Try setting "access_time: preserve"
2019-07-08 04:04:47	maeud	"touch" is the only state that makes sense I think
2019-07-08 04:04:55	maeud	OK I'll give it a go Kim^J
2019-07-08 04:05:56	maeud	Running now, be a minute or two

2019-07-08 07:53:25	ses1984	i'm trying to understand something about retries, the docs say "You must set the until parameter if you want a task to retry. If until is not defined, the value for the retries parameter is forced to 1." but without until, it seems the task is actually never retried, not even once
2019-07-08 07:54:09	ses1984	i'm trying to add retries to a `pip` install task that sometimes fails due to a network error, i see `ConnectionResetError: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer`
2019-07-08 07:54:33	ses1984	but i'm not sure what's in the `result` of the task if that happens, so i was trying to avoid figuring that out to write the `until` check
2019-07-08 07:55:29	ses1984	wouldn't it be more explicit to set retries to zero, or note in the docs that even though retries is set to 1, the task will not be retried at all?

2019-07-08 08:49:42	Phi03	When using Ansible Roles, copying a template. Usually it knows the file name as it looks in the templates folder. When you place another directory under templates and the file in that, so the path becomes "templates->install_zip->installer.zip", in the playbook do you then need the absoulute path from {{ inventory_dir }} ?

2019-07-08 11:22:44	@sivel	Sammitch: I would recommend that anytime you want a var to be a boolean, you can use the |bool filter
2019-07-08 11:23:12	@sivel	INI, and key=value syntax will generally result in strings, and that is largely what the |bool filter is designed for
2019-07-08 11:24:02	@sivel	You *can* get booleans from the INI format, but because it's an implementation detail rather than a feature, I don't recommend it, and won't divulge the means to do so :)
2019-07-08 11:24:38	@sivel	Use host_vars/group_vars instead, or switch to a different inventory format if you want it to interpret as a boolean without use of the |bool filter

2019-07-08 14:23:08	domino14_	but when i do ANSIBLE_INVENTORY_PLUGINS=/my/plugin/path ansible -i 'foo=bar;' it doesn't seem like my plugin got loaded at all. it says ` [WARNING]: Unable to parse /current/pwd/foo=bar; as an inventory source`
2019-07-08 14:23:25	@bcoca	looks like its trying to read as file
2019-07-08 14:23:25	domino14_	but my plugin code parses that "path" and turns it into something else. at the very least it prints out stuff to stdout
