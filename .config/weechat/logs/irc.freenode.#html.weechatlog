2019-07-01 12:48:02	_Raijin	Apologies for the dumb question. I am making a dead simple startpage and using <hr> tags to separate unordered lists of links. However, when I try to add more <hr> separators in between my <ul>s to accomodate more rows, they disappear in the most illogical way. The line separator will vanish from somewhere where it had previously appeared, as if there can only be so many on the page at once. 
2019-07-01 12:49:49	lilmonkey`	_Raijin, did you validate your code?
2019-07-01 12:50:05	lilmonkey`	Also note that you're using <hr> wrong, semantically.
2019-07-01 12:50:36	lilmonkey`	That doesn't explain your issue, but it does mean you should (re)learn the basics of modern, semantic HTML.
2019-07-01 12:53:18	_Raijin	lilmonkey` you're right, I usually never touch html except for when updating my custom pages... 
2019-07-01 12:54:20	_Raijin	I understand they are supposed to break up a page by semantic topic, but I was levereging their visual properties. I inherited the structure of the page from someone else.
2019-07-01 12:55:41	lilmonkey`	Just as easy with some extremely simple CSS…
2019-07-01 12:57:01	_Raijin	lilmonkey` I have a css file that declares colors and styles for the hr... but nothing that would explain the behavior I get.
2019-07-01 12:57:08	_Raijin	https://gist.github.com/GideonWolfe/3ea103f00b7e2c6a2ee1f6f8b8385a03 if you want to take a peek

2019-07-01 12:58:34	lilmonkey`	You have at least 15 errors in that tiny bit of code, the 15th being a fatal one so it might be more.
2019-07-01 12:58:43	lilmonkey`	https://checker.html5.org
2019-07-01 13:01:24	_Raijin	Thanks for the tip! No errors popped up in vim, classic mistake. Hopefully fixing those will mend my issue
2019-07-01 13:04:55	_Raijin	lilmonkey` it seems that those errors just popped up when I sloppily edited the file for my gist. Running the whole file through the checker yeilds no errors...

2019-07-01 13:19:00	lilmonkey`	I'm not seeing a problem.
2019-07-01 13:19:21	_Raijin	lilmonkey` Interesting. I am not either when opening it in chrome... Just a firefox thing?
2019-07-01 13:20:02	lilmonkey`	You mean the last one not showing?
2019-07-01 13:20:53	_Raijin	yes. and trying to fix it will wack it up. Like it will show 2 lines if you add another <hr> but it won't show just the one
2019-07-01 13:22:26	lilmonkey`	Oh this *is* weird. I can also get other ones to magically disppear, or even show up partially.
2019-07-01 13:25:21	lilmonkey`	Looks like some sort of rendering issue.
2019-07-01 13:25:59	lilmonkey`	Oh well, <hr> is best avoided anyway. The semantic use it's been given is extremely limited, unnecessary and forced.
2019-07-01 13:26:17	lilmonkey`	Just remove them and set borders on the <ul>'s and done.
2019-07-01 13:27:06	lilmonkey`	I mean, you're already using CSS border styles for the <hr>s, heh…

2019-07-02 03:23:14	lilltiger	did it end up in neat html? :D or was it not worth it
2019-07-02 03:23:37	stennowork	nope
2019-07-02 03:23:40	stennowork	er
2019-07-02 03:23:46	stennowork	it failed
2019-07-02 03:24:18	stennowork	tried to create a 'custom' html input element of type file and somehow trigger the open file dialog
2019-07-02 03:25:29	stennowork	lilltiger, my poor attempt https://jsfiddle.net/mrpowy48/1/
2019-07-02 03:25:38	stennowork	the click thing does _not_ work
2019-07-02 03:26:56	stennowork	it makes sense that it doesn't work but its also saddening
2019-07-02 03:27:18	stennowork	if i understood the specs correctly, the open file dialog must only be opened from a users click interaction
2019-07-02 03:30:49	Pilum	Yeah, they're rather strict with that particular element.
2019-07-02 03:30:59	stennowork	makes sense ;)
2019-07-02 03:31:14	Pilum	Indeed. There were some… incidents. :-P

2019-07-05 03:17:05	aruns	Hey guys, I am working on a site where it is using the SangBleu Kingdom Bold font for this text - https://res.cloudinary.com/dqck9npmf/image/upload/v1562321628/a-and-l-do-not-line-up_fnnqii.png - the trouble is that there is a slight gap between the 'A' and the 'L' - the left tip of the L is not the same height as the right tip of the A.
2019-07-05 03:17:10	aruns	Does anyone have any ideas as to how I can remove this gap? I have tried various font smoothing techniques, but they don't seem to be working. I presume it is just a limitation of the webfont.
