2019-05-09 23:14:18	twkm	a cv wait can spuriously wake so you need something concrete to indicate if you should go back to waiting and the mutex must protect it.

2019-05-09 23:21:52	_Raijin	Please correct me if I am misunderstanding, but the main thread sends cond_signal() to the condition variable corresponding to each thread. This signal says "the condition is met resources are ok to use" right? so then why is it wrong to initialize this variable in my thread function?
2019-05-09 23:22:27	twkm	because main might try to signal using the cv before the thread func has a chance to init it.

2019-05-09 23:24:53	_Raijin	Interesting, placing a sleep(3); before my loop of cond_signals() seemed to do the trick. Is there a practical way to ensure the cond_variable is initialized before signaling it? i have not heard of anyone else (in my class) running into this issue
2019-05-09 23:24:55	twkm	so you initialize a cv but main may already be beyond the loop that signals, so nothing signals using the newly initialized cv thus the thread never wakes.

2019-05-09 23:27:55	_Raijin	I have a function called initGlobals, seems like a good place to put it :)

2019-05-09 23:29:28	_Raijin	I think my confusion was stemming from the fact that declaring an array of pthread_mutex implicitly initializes them. The same cannot be said for CVs

2019-05-09 23:44:46	twkm	a thread usually uses a cv thusyly: lock; while (!predicate) wait; work; unlock; meanwhile some other thread would: lock: setpredicate; signal; unlock; implying that the cv, mutex and predicate already exist.
2019-05-09 23:45:31	twkm	the sleep gives the threads time to get started and read their wait's.

2019-05-10 04:48:29	candide	T *p = malloc(sizeof *p) is a much more robust idiom than T *p = malloc(sizeof (T)) because there is no chance of the sizeof (T) failing to match up with the T that was used to declare p. It's also more concise and easier to read.

Most buffer overflows overwrite memory from lower to higher memory addresses, so in order to overwrite the return pointer (and thus take control of the process) the canary value must also be overwritten.

2019-05-10 09:18:46	Foaly	what?
2019-05-10 09:19:09	JoshShell	This code is like:  struct x{ void* ptr; } = { NULL };    struct x y;

2019-05-10 09:23:46	dho	Foaly: the tailq implementations use it to initialize the tail pointer so that you can easily switch out list types with a find/replace.

2019-05-10 09:29:42	JoshShell	Anyway, my question is really about: Is this C or C++?
2019-05-10 09:29:50	dho	uh huh. and it doesn't generate what you pasted.
2019-05-10 09:29:55	dho	it's C.

2019-05-10 09:31:00	reberti	what?
2019-05-10 09:31:33	dho	the example is e.g. LIST_HEAD(h, e) head = LIST_HEAD_INITIALIZER(head);
2019-05-10 09:31:42	JoshShell	OK
2019-05-10 09:31:52	dho	which certainly doesn't generate struct x { ... } = { NULL }

2019-05-10 09:32:22	dho	it is not valid syntax.

2019-05-10 10:15:11	JoshShell	head is a variable.
2019-05-10 10:15:19	fizzie	Looking at one SLIST_HEAD definition, `SLIST_HEAD(slisthead,entry)head=SLIST_HEAD_INITIALIZER(head);` would expand to `struct slisthead { struct entry *slh_first; } head = { NULL };` which is valid C.
2019-05-10 10:15:43	JoshShell	OK thank you.
2019-05-10 10:15:51	JoshShell	It's a confusing API though.

2019-05-10 18:14:55	_Raijin	codeandkey: The ctime man page just mentioned converting a time object into a string. If I created a string buffer and then stored the output there, Would I be able to reuse ctime and get the right output?
2019-05-10 18:15:03	fizzie	(Or use strftime, which writes to a buffer you give it.)
2019-05-10 18:15:23	fizzie	I mean, in your specific case the simplest thing is just `printf(" startTime = %s", ctime(start)); printf(" endTime = %s", ctime(end));`

2019-05-10 18:16:16	_Raijin	printf("Time is %s\n", ctime(&myTAptr->endTime));
2019-05-10 18:16:23	_Raijin	That looks like what I'm doing?
2019-05-10 18:16:36	fizzie	printf(" startTime = %s endTime = %s", ctime(&myThreadArg->startTime), ctime(&myThreadArg->endTime));
2019-05-10 18:16:56	fizzie	That's in your pasted program, and looks like the bit that generated the output you showed.
2019-05-10 18:17:31	codeandkey	_Raijin: that's correct. the problem is that both invocations of ctime() happen *before* the output is printed
2019-05-10 18:17:55	codeandkey	you could use ctime_r, which writes the result to a user-supplied buffer
2019-05-10 18:17:59	_Raijin	Apologies for the confusion. The function that is supposed to print the output is DisplayThreadArgs. I was printing the time elsewhere to try to track down the issue
2019-05-10 18:18:21	_Raijin	DisplayThreadArgs was provided for the assignment, so I shouldn't have to mess with it too much
2019-05-10 18:22:18	_Raijin	Thanks for the help all! Simply breaking the prints into two seperate statements with ctime calls seemed to work
2019-05-10 18:22:45	fizzie	Yes, it's just plain wrong. It's a shame something like that was provided as an example, if that was the case.
2019-05-10 18:22:56	fizzie	Also regarding the man page, mine says: "The return value points to a statically allocated string which might be overwritten by subsequent calls to any of the date and time functions."
2019-05-10 18:24:37	_Raijin	My prof is a 25 year Microsoft veteran and regularly hides bugs in assignments to troll us. I was tearing my hair out over a race condition and he just told us to fix it by adding a sleep sateent XD

(Of course none of the layout details are guaranteed, beyond the first member always having an offset of 0.)

2019-05-10 20:44:52	dave0	according to the struct padding faq (by esr?) sorting the members by size minimizes the waste from padding, either largest to smallest, or suprisingly smallest to largest

2019-05-11 03:12:15	twkm	EOF is wrong to test there, getline returns -1 which might not be the value of EOF -- and might not mean eof was reached.  of course if the stdin reference disappears you'll receive an eof indication even if veof is disabled so handling it is still sane.

2019-05-11 04:31:17	Xatenev	+b makes you unable to change nick too
2019-05-11 04:31:21	Xatenev	just a random guess though
2019-05-11 04:31:24	d3x0r	for other expressions than 'c++"  to return their previous value?
2019-05-11 04:31:58	ski	Xatenev : oh, i didn't know that. so `+q' doesn't ?
2019-05-11 04:32:12	Xatenev	i think it doesnt
2019-05-11 04:32:51	Xatenev	and it seems like candide sets a ban onto my ip so i cant rejoin, +q also allows joining (with another acc or anything)
2019-05-11 04:33:01	dave0	Xatenev: for straight line code, i use this:     temp = *head; *head = (*head)->next; free(temp);

2019-05-11 04:33:36	d3x0r	 temp = *head->next; free(*head );*head = temp;
2019-05-11 04:33:47	Xatenev	yea i used that too now
2019-05-11 04:33:57	ski	Xatenev : yes, i know. but it didn't kick, and so i was thinking that `+q' could as well have been used

2019-05-11 04:41:18	Xatenev	im just going through this repository https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/data-structures and implement them in C

It's not portable, but that's fine since these are system headers. Also strictly speaking the common initial sequence rule, C18 6.5.2.3p6, which is the bit that makes using the "wrong" struct type a little bit closer to okay, is only applicable to structures included in a union.)

2019-05-11 21:07:13	seebs	i am not sure what you would mean by "array techniques"
2019-05-11 21:07:16	scientes	only one of the best essay's written
2019-05-11 21:08:50	[rg]	thanks, i have not reached that section yet, I am reading it tho
2019-05-11 21:09:11	[rg]	well, i'm thinking of doing a undegrad thesis on array resizing
2019-05-11 21:09:21	scientes	what do you mean?
2019-05-11 21:09:26	[rg]	in regards to the growth rate
2019-05-11 21:09:36	scientes	you still are not explaining yourself
2019-05-11 21:09:47	[rg]	of an "arraylist" or "dynamic array"
2019-05-11 21:10:02	[rg]	more?
2019-05-11 21:10:05	scientes	still not explaining yourself....
2019-05-11 21:10:17	[rg]	ok
2019-05-11 21:10:19	[rg]	one sec
2019-05-11 21:10:24	seebs	okay, what *about* array resizing? "is it a good idea?" "what are good scaling factors to use?" "how should one implement this?"
2019-05-11 21:10:40	[rg]	yes, the last two
2019-05-11 21:11:14	scientes	yeah, you still haven't said anything
2019-05-11 21:11:20	scientes	you haven't even defined "array" in this context
2019-05-11 21:11:56	seebs	i think scaling factors have been studied fairly thoroughly, with some amount of tradeoff between how much space you might waste and how much copying you have to do.
2019-05-11 21:12:28	scientes	seebs, well that makes sense, but i don't know how you got that from what [rg] said
2019-05-11 21:12:38	scientes	I guess [rg] is talking about compiler design
2019-05-11 21:12:52	[rg]	no not compilers
2019-05-11 21:12:58	[rg]	just in genereal
2019-05-11 21:13:03	[rg]	like what seebs said
2019-05-11 21:13:05	seebs	heck if i know. C has not historically had resizeable storage in compilers, so i was assuming libraries for providing some kind of array-ish functionality.
2019-05-11 21:13:30	scientes	[rg], yeah but in general a C array is hardly anything, and its just some math
2019-05-11 21:13:41	scientes	if you want to talk about hardware, then you have to specify what you are talking about
2019-05-11 21:14:18	scientes	i guess you are talking about the trade-offs of packing arrays

2019-05-11 21:14:37	seebs	i think this isn't so much C arrays, as "using pointers, reallocation, and copying to create a thing that behaves like an array but can be resized".
2019-05-11 21:14:43	scientes	maybe you should look at all the complicated ways that git compresses stuff
2019-05-11 21:15:05	[rg]	yeah thanks for explaining seebs
2019-05-11 21:15:10	scientes	you mean the elements can be expliained?
2019-05-11 21:15:20	scientes	and all of them, or just some of them?

2019-05-11 21:15:45	johnjay	but what IS an array, really?
2019-05-11 21:15:50	scientes	^^^^
2019-05-11 21:15:53	scientes	this is just math
2019-05-11 21:16:11	seebs	everything the computer does is arguably just math :)
2019-05-11 21:16:13	[rg]	a random access list, with elements aligned in a region of memory
2019-05-11 21:16:21	scientes	seebs, yes, but math in 4 dimensions

2019-05-11 21:16:47	seebs	but if you're doing a thing that provides an array type which allows you to, say, append items and possibly cause the array to be reallocated so they fit, there's a bunch of research in the field of how to do this reasonably efficiently
2019-05-11 21:17:12	scientes	generally you just do it stupid
2019-05-11 21:17:15	scientes	or with a hash table
2019-05-11 21:18:12	seebs	anyway, rg, you might look at the way go handles this, with slices, since their slice ops are actually a fair bit like the idioms that people tend to reinvent for doing this in C.
2019-05-11 21:18:25	scientes	slices are in a lot of languages
2019-05-11 21:18:30	johnjay	we need a website with that title
2019-05-11 21:18:34	scientes	for good reason
2019-05-11 21:18:35	johnjay	"Things people tend to reinvent in C"
2019-05-11 21:18:56	seebs	i am aware that many languages have a thing called slices. the specifics of how the go ones work might be of interest to someone wanting to do research on dynamically-sized-arrays in C.

2019-05-11 21:20:35	scientes	but in go slices can always alias
2019-05-11 21:20:46	scientes	go is full of decisions to be easy, rather than fast
2019-05-11 21:20:56	seebs	specifics like how to decide when to resize and how much to resize, but also the idiom of `x = append(x, ...)`, which turns out to provide a consistent way to handle the "but what if it gets reallocated" thing.
2019-05-11 21:21:04	scientes	while keeping the scalability there though, so it has decent performance
2019-05-11 21:21:33	seebs	anyway, maybe it'll be useful to rg, maybe not. i'm gonna go make food.

2019-05-11 22:54:38	Samian	I want to inline a function. Do I put __inline only before the function in the c file, or do I do that too for the function declaration in header file?

2019-05-11 22:56:30	Foaly	Samian, if you want to inline it, you have to define it in the header

2019-05-11 23:02:56	computerquip	I would suggest just making it static instead.
2019-05-11 23:03:49	computerquip	Kind of a weird thing to do on the outside but, unless you're using C++ where inline is more than just a hint, it's usually ignored or doesn't do what you want.

2019-05-12 10:22:58	_Raijin	tradar did you suggest the lea would be triggered by reassigning a variable with user input?
2019-05-12 10:24:05	tradar	_Raijin: no, i said that is possibly useful.. because the LEA instruction is generated only with code optimizations and the same code optimizations might just calculate the result of the expression if the values of all variables are known in advance at compiling time.
2019-05-12 10:25:28	tradar	basically the compiler could turn "n = (h << 3) + b + 8;"  into "n = 64;" ... so without writing a lea.
2019-05-12 10:26:01	_Raijin	tradar: my bad, i misunderstood. I have narrowed it down quite a bit. There's a single operation, and the result of that operation is assigned to x. I just need to figure out which operation it is, that would generate identical instructions.

2019-05-12 20:37:36	d3x0r	it could be that consts are in readonly memory; but that's not required

2019-05-12 20:38:50	d3x0r	char *x = strdup( "something" );   strchr( x, 'o' );    strchr will cast to const char *
2019-05-12 20:38:55	d3x0r	but it's not in readonly memory

2019-05-12 20:44:52	d3x0r	because strchr could also work on readonly memory strchr(const char *, char )

2019-05-12 20:46:10	d3x0r	but when everything (EVERYTHING) is dynamically allocated, and there is nothing inmutable... it becomes a little vague.  Because really functions could modify 'const' buffers temporarily as long as it gets reset before returning noone should be the sizer

2019-05-13 05:11:43	Xatenev	uso_, I find a visual interface for gdb to be very very helpful
2019-05-13 05:11:52	Xatenev	and actual good intellisense is nice too..

2019-05-13 05:12:29	Xatenev	yeah which is awful :D

2019-05-13 05:13:00	Xatenev	but still not good
2019-05-13 05:13:23	Xatenev	uso_, i dont understand, is that related to the intellisense?
2019-05-13 05:13:27	uso_	yes
2019-05-13 05:13:31	Xatenev	its not just that though
2019-05-13 05:13:40	uso_	replace you have sed
2019-05-13 05:13:46	uso_	and you can use ctags
2019-05-13 05:13:55	Xatenev	ctags isn't too good

2019-05-13 05:14:21	Xatenev	and compare the helpful information you get
2019-05-13 05:14:44	Xatenev	of course you _can_ do all the stuff without an IDE but you don't have to.

2019-05-13 05:16:08	Xatenev	because theres no way you can work faster with gdb itself than with a proper visual interface for it,
2019-05-13 05:16:25	VladTheImplier	This kinda mirrors my programming journey. starting out with the hand holding of VisualStudio and C#. You can auto-complete 50% of your work. Then moved to sublimetext when I switched to C. The amount of torture I put sublime through to make ST like VS in terms of hand holding and debugging made it crash every single hour. Letting go of that was so hard.

2019-05-13 05:18:21	othias	Xatenev: sometimes with IDEs you have to wade through lots of windows, subwindows, buttons and whatnot to find that one checkbox you're looking for (I'm looking at you eclipse), where a simple command or additional argument would do the job in a CLI
2019-05-13 05:18:34	othias	but I agree that intellisense is useful for huge projects or projects you're not too familiar with
2019-05-13 05:19:13	Xatenev	othias, sure - you don't have to use the IDE for _everything_ if you have a commadn that does the job easy and simple just use it
2019-05-13 05:19:25	Xatenev	othias, its not exclusive, you can use both :]
2019-05-13 05:19:27	VladTheImplier	othias: I adore this sort of minimalism. I always wanted that. Now my Makefiles are longer than some of my smaller side projects.
2019-05-13 05:19:40	uso_	well, yes but in C even with linux generally git grep is enough, with other language that use polymorphisme a lot(java ?), intellisense is usefull
2019-05-13 05:20:13	othias	Xatenev: yeah I suppose, but I'm a binary kind of person, sadly lol
2019-05-13 05:20:18	Xatenev	uso_, why would you deny static analysis if you can have it? :P
2019-05-13 05:20:34	uso_	make check
2019-05-13 05:20:50	Xatenev	??
2019-05-13 05:20:58	Xatenev	that isnt the same:D
2019-05-13 05:21:03	uso_	why would you make your static analysis IDE specific if you can integrate it to you makefile
2019-05-13 05:21:15	Xatenev	to save you all the trouble?
2019-05-13 05:21:20	Xatenev	my time isn't free :D
2019-05-13 05:21:28	Xatenev	and its not necessarily the same
2019-05-13 05:21:44	Xatenev	I wanna see the make checks that do all the static analysis a good IDE does
2019-05-13 05:22:39	Xatenev	it sounds to me like you just want to go the "minimalist" style by not relying on any tools, even if it might be a good idea in that situation
2019-05-13 05:23:15	uso_	don't know gcc have ointegrate most of them as warning, clang static analysis id usefull, but I've never saw an IDE that integrate that kind of analysis

2019-05-13 05:25:02	Xatenev	and I had to do a lot with people that just generally deny the "new" stuff which I find to be very annoying, instead of making an actual analysis whether it would be a good idea or not
2019-05-13 05:26:20	othias	meh, I guess it mostly comes down to how well you know the tools you use (GUI or otherwise)

2019-05-13 05:27:42	VladTheImplier	Xatenev: True. Rejection of the new comes with that mind set I think. It's the kind comfort zone that you try to build. And building that is ultimately a waste of time - but it's just so much fun. othias: Yeah - getting blasted is with 100 icons when opening up a program is not what comfy is.
2019-05-13 05:28:02	Xatenev	othias, I find most C ide's to be very bad too
2019-05-13 05:28:14	Xatenev	just found joy in CLion which is really amazing
2019-05-13 05:28:26	VladTheImplier	heh... CLion :D

2019-05-13 08:02:24	dho	on a ds9k, you send the bits to a cloud provider which converts them to a random supported representation and returns them to you with information on what representation was used, and then an interpreter determines whether the two representations have the same value.

I've never coded in my entire life, so I'm here trying to get help to modify a C code from an eggdrop module. unfortunately, the module developer seems to be very busy in real life and things didn't went forward. the module I'm trying to modify is a channel stats generator (words, kicks, etc). unfortunately the module seems to work based on users hostname (so if you change from nick A to nick B, stats are still counted to nick A).
2019-05-13 13:15:58	Exterminador	 the dev advised me to try to modify the 'maskstricthost' function in misc.c and that's where I'm choking at

Now, can I typedef this somehow so declaration "struct sp s" is the same as "struct s *s"? Sure, I know how to do "sp s;", but I would like to force the usage of "struct sp s;". Is it even possible?

2019-05-13 20:04:45	gwosix	twkn, what compilers do you use?
2019-05-13 20:05:29	twkm	many, a number of which don't try to clone gcc.
2019-05-13 20:06:04	gwosix	yeah, me too, but which ones "crash on compile" when they find a `#pragma`?
2019-05-13 20:06:38	novns	#pragma once  is supported by every modern compiler
2019-05-13 20:06:44	twkm	wrong.
2019-05-13 20:06:45	t0xik	,rb
2019-05-13 20:07:08	gwosix	well, if i was to write one right now nouns, it probably wouldn't
2019-05-13 20:07:17	twkm	depends on options, even gcc will fail to compile with it present if you want the highest level of portability.
2019-05-13 20:07:17	novns	you don't need preprocessors from 1970s
2019-05-13 20:07:40	twkm	heh, such as the cpp.  funny.

2019-05-13 20:08:35	gwosix	it works with `-std=c99` with clang
2019-05-13 20:08:42	twkm	the latter is only for glibc.
2019-05-13 20:08:57	gwosix	yeah, i'm on musl though
2019-05-13 20:09:24	twkm	and musl.  the feature test macro is for api provided by the library not gcc.
2019-05-13 20:09:42	twkm	even when asking gcc for a certain conformance it isn't strict without additional options.
2019-05-13 20:10:25	twkm	so c11 except where it let you do something non-standard, that it might not warn about so you've no idea your code isn't portable.
2019-05-13 20:10:33	gwosix	yeah, don't ask gnu though, just don't

2019-05-13 20:19:41	rotatorexperimen	Please pardon me if im wrong,  I’m completely new to C.
2019-05-13 20:20:07	rotatorexperimen	Twkm, can you elaborate?
2019-05-13 20:21:28	twkm	given you are ignorant of c it might waste both of our time, but consider what's being done in main and if it seems reasonable just rename it and produce a library instead of an executable.
2019-05-13 20:22:12	twkm	e.g., if main calls exit is that appropriate for the code if viewed as a library -- no right answer, just consider it.
2019-05-13 20:22:45	twkm	but if it isn't appropriate to exit you need to consider doing something else, perhaps a plain return would work.

2019-05-14 03:29:49	mort	if you just need it to be free, circleci and travis work
2019-05-14 03:29:55	lm-	trcc: you can take a look at buildbot, quite powerfull since you write config in python
2019-05-14 03:30:12	trcc	ahh cool
2019-05-14 03:30:13	lm-	oh sorry, I though you said 'self-hosted'
2019-05-14 03:30:19	trcc	did not now travis and circleci was for free
2019-05-14 03:30:26	mort	though sr.ht has the advantage of letting you build against freebsd, and more niche things like alpine which lets you test with musl instead of glibc

2019-05-14 04:07:01	gwosix	i see supermacros' use, but i don't think i'd ever find them useful...
2019-05-14 04:07:02	mort	the most portable way to bundle some arbitrary file with your binary, afaik, is to have one tool which converts any file into an expression which results in a string or char array, and use the above pattern
2019-05-14 04:07:25	gwosix	yeah, that makes sense

2019-05-14 08:01:07	tane	aveng3r, there are various approaches, are you generating the code of the sort-algorithm on demand?
2019-05-14 08:01:17	uso_	aveng3r: the advantage of define is that you are sure that your func will be inline, static inline function are cleaner, but I guess it's hard for compiler to inline function pointer (but sometime they do it sucesfuly)
2019-05-14 08:01:28	botayhard	as far as I know, no
2019-05-14 08:02:11	botayhard	but you always can define yourself
2019-05-14 08:02:12	tane	uso_, if define works, then the code is generated, which makes it easy to just provide the function (without pointer) it being easy to inline

2019-05-14 16:13:13	caze	junon: What would you do with nested functions?
2019-05-14 16:13:59	junon	A bit neater syntax for writing callbacks.
2019-05-14 16:14:29	caze	How so?
2019-05-14 16:14:39	junon	Sometimes, I don't care about a function having a name; the semantics of where a nested function appear would explain why it's necessary
2019-05-14 16:14:55	DarkUranium	caze, consider qsort()'s callback. You need to put it in global scope as a static function, sometimes far far away from the call.
2019-05-14 16:15:05	junon	e.g. with libuv, I have to name functions like `on_read_data`, `on_new_client_accepted`, etc.

2019-05-14 22:25:28	d3738	good way of integer overflow prevention is to use the unsigned integers. their overflow is defined and can be exploited with predictable results. check for UINT_MAX and similar boundary conditions in appropriate places, when parsing integers from strings check for overflow errors and special results returned by functions in case of overflow

2019-05-15 04:29:39	candide	T *p = malloc(sizeof *p) is a much more robust idiom than T *p = malloc(sizeof (T)) because there is no chance of the sizeof (T) failing to match up with the T that was used to declare p. It's also more concise and easier to read.

2019-05-15 15:12:51	howaboutsynergy	Hi. In a .c program writing with fprintf to both stdout and to some logfile, how can I prevent the writes ending up in the same file? ie. if shell ran `./a.out >logfile`
2019-05-15 15:13:19	howaboutsynergy	what i tried: https://github.com/libcheck/check/issues/188#issuecomment-492794060
2019-05-15 15:13:58	d3837	./a.out | tee logfile
2019-05-15 15:14:20	twkm	there is no way to tell in standard c.  other systems might allow you to compare low-level details.
