2019-09-08 13:18:37	_Raijin	Hello, is there a way to make an artist image default to an album cover if no artist image is found? Blank spaces in my library looks pretty ugly

2019-09-08 14:24:56	_Raijin	It just seems like a sane default that wouldn't be too hard to implement. The images are already there...
2019-09-08 14:25:59	JustAMan[m]	If you're not long with us you would be surprised by amount of places in inherited code where there is a sane default which isn't an actual default ;)
2019-09-08 14:26:18	JustAMan[m]	Poetry, man...
2019-09-08 14:35:02	_Raijin	You mean the option is already in the codebase but just not enabled?
2019-09-08 14:37:05	JustAMan[m]	No, I mean there are dozens and dozens of places where inherited default is crazy for whatever reason

2019-09-09 07:15:43	sparky[m]	by the time we catch up client wise, they will likely have done enough to differentiate themselves from us and stay in their niche

2019-09-09 07:24:59	sparky[m]	eh... i just dont see them going anywhere for awhile. especially with folks on their forums claiming we are nothing but thieves
2019-09-09 07:28:01	Mathijs[m]	I'm not really surprised that jellyfin has way more stars on github, that's a crowd where FOSS enthousiasts  are way overrepresented
2019-09-09 07:28:19	Mathijs[m]	but the fact that the jellyfin subreddit is already larger is surprising to me
2019-09-09 07:28:47	Mathijs[m]	AFAIK the reddit userbase isn't specifically leaning to FOSS
2019-09-09 07:30:08	dkanada[m]	I'm often surprised how much a lot of the tech subreddits will lean towards foss solutions
2019-09-09 07:48:06	sparky[m]	i think its cause a lot of folks are cheap fucks

2019-09-09 07:51:01	sparky[m]	think the biggest benefit of FOSS to them is that if they invest in it, effort wise, infra wise, whatever
2019-09-09 07:51:09	sparky[m]	its liable to stay free and functional for the forseeable future
2019-09-09 07:51:28	sparky[m]	prices wont just change on them making them have to reconsider using it or force them to find alternatives
2019-09-09 07:51:56	sparky[m]	they care less about the philosophy that causes this set of benefits (FOSS) than the fact they exist

2019-09-09 07:54:27	Jacob[m]2	<sparky[m] "think the biggest benefit of FOS"> A smart small business thinks about these things. Most businesses just see that something is free and puts it in as a bandaid solution until they can afford the enterprise version of whatever type of software they need. Unfortunately there is still a stigma that software is suppose to be paid for.

2019-09-09 07:56:05	sparky[m]	a lot of it is flat files on disk

2019-09-09 07:56:55	sparky[m]	yeah. my guess is that its multiple json files

2019-09-09 07:57:42	sparky[m]	dinki is a long time helper for making live tv nice and hes at it again with helping us find out how JF stores live tv data for the upcoming db rewrite
2019-09-09 07:58:16	sparky[m]	for the most part, none of the devs actually use live tv functionality. it largely only works because of dinki's awesomeness
2019-09-09 07:58:37	Jacob[m]2	Props to Dinki
2019-09-09 07:59:51	sparky[m]	he doesnt code any of it, but he makes it easier for the devs to make it work by a mile 🙂
2019-09-09 08:00:19	thornbill[m]	Definitely!

2019-09-09 08:18:00	dinki[m]	Schedules Direct
2019-09-09 08:22:39	dexdeadly[m]	Whats that $25?
2019-09-09 08:22:42	qurqar[m]	Is it possible to shift subtitles timing ?
2019-09-09 08:25:35	dinki[m]	dexdeadly: Yeah, and worth every penny to me.
2019-09-09 08:26:05	dinki[m]	You can try doing some xmltv scraping but not worth it for me.
2019-09-09 08:27:07	dinki[m]	search for mc2xml if you're budget is tight but I'd certainly recommend SD if you can swing it.
2019-09-09 08:30:53	sparky[m]	<qurqar[m] "Is it possible to shift subtitle"> you mean subs in their own file?
2019-09-09 08:30:57	sparky[m]	vs burned into the video?
2019-09-09 08:31:16	qurqar[m]	its own file
2019-09-09 08:32:07	sparky[m]	is it in the container or a true separate file?
2019-09-09 08:32:11	sparky[m]	if in the container, maybe
2019-09-09 08:33:34	qurqar[m]	that is easy with smplayer or vlc, you just push the timing up and down. I was wondering if Jf has a similar feature
2019-09-09 08:34:01	sparky[m]	not that im aware of. at this time anyways. perhaps kodi can help with that, it has offsets for audio/video
2019-09-09 08:34:10	sparky[m]	might have one for subs
2019-09-09 08:34:15	qurqar[m]	ok thanks
2019-09-09 08:34:29	dexdeadly[m]	dinki: Thats really not to bad of a price I might just do it when I get a few extra dollars.  I dont mind some of the xmltv scrapping but I like to do things.
2019-09-09 08:38:23	JustAMan[m]	<qurqar[m] "that is easy with smplayer or vl"> afaik we have this feature on web if subtitles are not burnt in and are in a separate file
2019-09-09 08:38:36	dinki[m]	SD is really nice.  I've been using it for many many years.  I'm pretty sure it provides a bit more information than scraping.  I didn't want to miss any recordings due to the scraper having problems and it's super easy to set up and very reliable.
2019-09-09 08:38:51	JustAMan[m]	qurqar: see for more here - https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-web/pull/220

2019-09-09 09:14:40	markbln	Fast Question: Ive locked out of my own jellyfin, password reset not working correctly, updatet ad newest version. How do i reset my Usersetting to No Password? I only use 2 Users! Thanks
2019-09-09 09:14:53	sparky[m]	heyo!
2019-09-09 09:15:35	sparky[m]	the easiest and most surefire way to to find the `system.xml` file and change the setting in there about the startup wizard to false so it can be run again to create a new admin
2019-09-09 09:15:48	sparky[m]	then, use that admin to change password and unlock
2019-09-09 09:15:52	markbln	Im Sorry for violation your Channel for my Problems, but i thought some can help here
2019-09-09 09:16:04	sparky[m]	login as your usual admin and delete the one that was created as part of this process
2019-09-09 09:16:52	sparky[m]	dont be sorry. this is the place to ask such stuff (well... #jellyfin-troubleshooting:matrix.org is but now we are just being nitpicky for something this quick to solve)
2019-09-09 09:17:20	markbln	Hey Sparky, thanks for your reply! That seems to be a fast&easy way to change this problem! i will test it right now
2019-09-09 09:18:18	sparky[m]	depending on your install method it can be in a few different places, but its in the JF config dir. for docker that `/config` and for debian i thing its `/etc/jellyfin`
2019-09-09 09:18:37	sparky[m]	but yeah, this is the easiest way to get it done. there are others, just not as simple

2019-09-09 09:28:09	JustAMan[m]	what "pin feature" bug?
2019-09-09 09:28:27	Henry151	lately, when I'm watching a TV show on my jellyfin, when i get to the ending credits of the episode and click the little rightward-facing skip-to-next button, instead, it restarts the episode
2019-09-09 09:28:36	Henry151	if i click it again, then, it does skip to the next episode
2019-09-09 09:28:52	Henry151	i double-checked and there are not duplicates of the episodes, so i'm a little puzzled. Any diagnosis advice?
2019-09-09 09:29:18	Henry151	happy to provide any logs or things or fill out a bug-report to specification
2019-09-09 09:30:24	JustAMan[m]	what are you using as a client?

2019-09-09 09:33:34	Henry151	oh well, of course, now i can't get it to reproduce the symptom
2019-09-09 09:33:43	Henry151	but i will check the dev console next time it happens

2019-09-09 09:34:48	Henry151	right.. you go to the dentist and while you're in the waiting-room your toothache goes away... as soon as you leave it comes back
2019-09-09 09:35:15	Henry151	i used to run a motorcycle shop and it was the same with that.

2019-09-09 10:43:42	halvor	hello
2019-09-09 10:43:45	halvor	i found a webOS client on github
2019-09-09 10:43:47	halvor	but there's no info about how to install it
2019-09-09 10:49:47	sparky[m]	if thats EraYaN's or JustAMan's its likely because its still indev
2019-09-09 10:49:55	sparky[m]	got a link? might be able to help that way
2019-09-09 10:50:11	halvor	https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-webos
2019-09-09 10:50:42	sparky[m]	yeah. iirc, thats still indev
2019-09-09 10:50:47	halvor	i have no idea how webos works
2019-09-09 10:51:04	halvor	but i guess it'd have to be a jar or something
2019-09-09 10:51:07	halvor	ah, i see
2019-09-09 10:51:45	halvor	i was just reading on reddit that the emby client is looking for the string jell and breaks if its found
2019-09-09 10:51:53	halvor	that's awful
2019-09-09 10:52:15	halvor	i am using jellyfin everywhere, linux laptop, tablets
2019-09-09 10:52:23	halvor	only the tv is missing
2019-09-09 10:52:30	halvor	great stuff
2019-09-09 10:52:34	sparky[m]	yeah, and they did it with ASCII codes so it wasnt easily searchable
2019-09-09 10:52:37	sparky[m]	we had to dig to find it
2019-09-09 10:53:09	halvor	but hats off to jellyfin devs
2019-09-09 10:53:24	halvor	i find it a lot better in certain things than emby
2019-09-09 10:53:39	halvor	the metadata part appears to be a lot better
2019-09-09 10:53:55	halvor	compared to the last time i used emby
2019-09-09 10:54:21	sparky[m]	slowly but surely we are picking up the messes we inherited 🙂 glad to see you are liking it so far
2019-09-09 10:55:12	halvor	it's awesome, really
2019-09-09 10:57:45	halvor	i'd be happy to help with anything that requires nlp, but there's nothing in python/swift/go
2019-09-09 10:59:21	mcarlton[m]	kodi and mopidy clients are in python, if you feel like diving in.  And contributions to the docs are always welcome
2019-09-09 10:59:43	sparky[m]	python is kodi
2019-09-09 11:00:55	sparky[m]	we dont really have swift, but you are welcome to make a native iOS app or you can join thornbill in making the expo one he is working on now nice
2019-09-09 11:01:12	sparky[m]	nice = ready for apple app store and users
2019-09-09 11:02:19	halvor	my field is language processing, so i only could contribute to the metadata parsing part at best
2019-09-09 11:02:39	halvor	or localisation
2019-09-09 11:05:25	sparky[m]	my field is systems administration but i still fixed bugs. that said... mcarlton does the kodi client support localization? if so... might want to see about getting it onto weblate
2019-09-09 11:09:51	dinki[m]	Pretty sure 10.4.0RC will have problems with Android TV client unless something has changed in the past few days ... thornbill sparky
2019-09-09 11:10:45	dinki[m]	bahaha.. It says right in the description on reddit ... kicks self
2019-09-09 11:11:18	thornbill[m]	Lol yeah that’s definitely one of the big known issues
2019-09-09 11:11:48	dinki[m]	also I think trakt is still broken?
2019-09-09 11:12:06	JoshuaBoniface[m	yea a couple plugins are
2019-09-09 11:12:07	JoshuaBoniface[m	LDAP is another one
2019-09-09 11:12:16	JoshuaBoniface[m	gotta hammer out some fixes to those soonish
2019-09-09 11:15:37	mcarlton[m]	I think it does?  I'm pretty sure I saw a PR go by a few weeks ago about other language options
2019-09-09 11:17:16	mcarlton[m]	yeah, there was one for chinese a while back https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-kodi/pull/48
2019-09-09 11:17:39	mcarlton[m]	not sure what it'll take getting it into weblate, but if somebody starts the work i'll certainly help review and test stuff
2019-09-09 11:17:47	JoshuaBoniface[m	oh yea that reminds me, weblate was broke for kodi, had to fix some perms on the repo but it's good now
2019-09-09 11:19:56	JoshuaBoniface[m	oh it's already there: https://translate.jellyfin.org/projects/jellyfin/jellyfin-kodi/
2019-09-09 11:24:53	essasetic[m]	Just wanna say congrats on the 10.4 RC Release.
2019-09-09 11:25:10	essasetic[m]	I was looking at the project progress and saw it coming closer and closer day by day.
2019-09-09 11:25:26	essasetic[m]	Hope a stable release will come out of it soon. :)
2019-09-09 11:26:26	sparky[m]	me too. 10.4.0 is huge
2019-09-09 11:26:40	essasetic[m]	It definitely looks that way
2019-09-09 11:26:59	essasetic[m]	This looks like it would be a 11.0.0 release
2019-09-09 11:27:09	essasetic[m]	With the UI theme change and tons of fixes
2019-09-09 11:27:37	TrueTechy[m]	<sparky[m] "my field is systems administrati"> The localisation is setup in the files under languages. It makes uses of https://docs.python.org/3/library/gettext.html I'm sure
2019-09-09 11:28:08	dexdeadly[m]	dinki: sorry I left.  Actually just took a look and I believe it didn't pull all of my HomeRun channels I just deleted it and when I try auto discover it does not find it
2019-09-09 11:29:33	dexdeadly[m]	looks like I also need to update to 10.4
2019-09-09 11:30:16	JoshuaBoniface[m	<essasetic[m] "This looks like it would be a 11"> we still haven't; done the db replacement or revampped the API, which are the two big things we set out for for an 11.0, so, not yet :P
2019-09-09 11:31:10	sparky[m]	its still a long ways out 🙂
2019-09-09 11:31:17	JoshuaBoniface[m	yup
2019-09-09 11:31:33	dexdeadly[m]	Is nightly stable?
2019-09-09 11:31:41	essasetic[m]	> > <@essasetic:matrix.org> This looks like it would be a 11.0.0 release
2019-09-09 11:31:42	essasetic[m]	> we still haven't; done the db replacement or revampped the API, which are the two big things we set out for for an 11.0, so, not yet :P
2019-09-09 11:31:43	essasetic[m]	Ok that's a BIG goal.
2019-09-09 11:31:52	JoshuaBoniface[m	it generally works, but some things are indeed broke
2019-09-09 11:32:03	JoshuaBoniface[m	ldap and trakt plugins are big ones
2019-09-09 11:32:04	dexdeadly[m]	LDAP still not working in 10.4?
2019-09-09 11:32:09	essasetic[m]	If you don't care about Android TV and LADP
2019-09-09 11:32:12	dexdeadly[m]	ok then I will wait :)
2019-09-09 11:32:18	essasetic[m]	Then yeah you could consider it stable
2019-09-09 11:32:19	JoshuaBoniface[m	heh probably for the best
2019-09-09 11:32:28	JoshuaBoniface[m	a new one builds every night if there's been PRs merged the day before
2019-09-09 11:32:32	dinki[m]	dexdeadly: Yes.. and something was fixed in regards to IPTV that was causing JF to crash my docker container so it's good.
2019-09-09 11:33:08	dexdeadly[m]	Actually I was kind of curious of putting androidtv on this little mini pc someone gave me.  I just have to get around to it
2019-09-09 11:33:09	essasetic[m]	I also saw some x265 fixes getting merged so that'll be interesting
2019-09-09 11:33:11	dexdeadly[m]	I use the LDAP so I dont wanna break that currently so I can wait.
2019-09-09 11:33:37	dinki[m]	dexdeadly: Android TV has some issues with the nightly/RC though.
2019-09-09 11:33:57	JoshuaBoniface[m	good idea, i upgraded mine and it's quite broke, and can't revert bck dpwn to stable
2019-09-09 11:34:06	JoshuaBoniface[m	luckily my users sessions are still valid 😆
2019-09-09 11:34:47	sparky[m]	looks like you need to find and fix the bug fast then Joshua Boniface  XD
2019-09-09 11:34:54	dexdeadly[m]	haha
2019-09-09 11:35:00	essasetic[m]	I'm thinking when Jellyfin hits a year anniversary we should do a write-up on what it has achieved in a year.
2019-09-09 11:35:04	JoshuaBoniface[m	yea that's probably my tonight or tomorrow night project
2019-09-09 11:35:05	essasetic[m]	<sparky[m] "looks like you need to find and "> also lmao
2019-09-09 11:35:11	JoshuaBoniface[m	depends how far I get on my PDU tonight before my fingers stop working...
2019-09-09 11:35:24	dexdeadly[m]	If you want a second test let me know I'm usually around and use it
2019-09-09 11:35:27	dexdeadly[m]	I use AD
2019-09-09 11:35:34	essasetic[m]	I won't mind helping out if I get any spare time & I'm bored.
2019-09-09 11:35:50	JoshuaBoniface[m	it should be fine once it compiles again, it's some funciton compat between the jellyfin.controller library
2019-09-09 11:35:52	essasetic[m]	(that happens very often on weekends lol)
2019-09-09 11:35:57	JoshuaBoniface[m	this happened once before, we just had to add wrapper functions
2019-09-09 11:36:47	sparky[m]	ill be upgrading to nightly tonight. see what all the fuss is about
2019-09-09 11:37:00	sparky[m]	i still havent experienced the performance boost... i feel left out in a way
2019-09-09 11:37:15	JoshuaBoniface[m	heh
2019-09-09 11:37:20	JoshuaBoniface[m	it definitely feels faster to me
2019-09-09 11:37:30	dinki[m]	It definitely IS faster for me
2019-09-09 11:37:36	dexdeadly[m]	LoL me 2, I know I ran nightly and was like WEEEE but no LDAP and then sad face
2019-09-09 11:37:59	essasetic[m]	I'll have to test it out when it goes stable
2019-09-09 11:38:08	essasetic[m]	Speed improvements does seem very exciting
2019-09-09 11:40:03	dexdeadly[m]	you guys using docker compose?  If so are you setting an environment variable for the app_uid or app_gid or something similar?  I noticed all the folders say in collection are owned by bin bin so my guess is that is why it wont delete a collection even though it was created
2019-09-09 11:40:21	sparky[m]	stability is overated
2019-09-09 11:40:33	sparky[m]	come, join us in nightly land essasetic
2019-09-09 11:40:35	dexdeadly[m]	living on that programming edge
2019-09-09 11:40:55	essasetic[m]	sparky: eh, I do have a Video station server running anyway so...
2019-09-09 11:41:09	essasetic[m]	Alright I'll go to the nightly land
2019-09-09 11:41:31	sparky[m]	<dexdeadly[m] "you guys using docker compose?  "> not using docker compose but i am setting the UID and GID of the container process. works fine for me that way
2019-09-09 11:41:32	JoshuaBoniface[m	<sparky[m] "stability is overated"> stability is a frame of mind
2019-09-09 11:41:58	sparky[m]	exactly. it has nothing to do with the quality of software and its apparent lack of bugs
2019-09-09 11:42:50	essasetic[m]	Once DSM decides to load anyway...
2019-09-09 11:43:02	essasetic[m]	Downloading is really not playing nice
2019-09-09 11:43:35	essasetic[m]	(downloading directly to the NAS is probably not helping)
2019-09-09 11:44:01	essasetic[m]	Alright, bye 10.3.7 container. Time to start fresh!
2019-09-09 11:45:18	essasetic[m]	nightly-20190909 I'm guessing is the right file?
2019-09-09 11:45:21	 <<< 	halvor (~peter@178-164-233-187.pool.digikabel.hu) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2019-09-09 11:46:06	JoshuaBoniface[m	likely, yes
2019-09-09 11:46:14	essasetic[m]	Ok downloading it...
2019-09-09 11:47:25	sparky[m]	you can just use the nightly tag. should be updated to the specific version each time
2019-09-09 11:48:00	essasetic[m]	Oh I see.
2019-09-09 11:48:12	essasetic[m]	I'll remember that for next time
2019-09-09 11:48:39	Gravity[m]	Would anyone be able to assist me in setting up my jellyfin with a reverse proxy on windows? I'm not too familiar with it, but the docs seemed fairly Linux based. I'm not sure how much it matters...
2019-09-09 11:48:39	Gravity[m]	But I never evem actually got to the point of the reverse proxy, I was trying to start setting stuff up the other day but it was extremely confusing. I was getting stuck on setting up a domain. So I grabbed a domain name from .tk and was going to start by assigning a certificate to it so It's not using http.. yet I couldn't for the life of me understand how to do this on windows. I was using certify the web, and Idk I
2019-09-09 11:48:40	Gravity[m]	was just getting lost. (After this I planned on going through and setting up the reverse proxy, but I couldn't even get the certificates lol)
2019-09-09 11:50:06	sparky[m]	you didnt pay for a certificate did you?
2019-09-09 11:50:12	Gravity[m]	no
2019-09-09 11:50:25	Gravity[m]	nor did I pay for the domain (It's a free .tk domain)
2019-09-09 11:50:32	sparky[m]	cool. dont worry about the certificate for now
2019-09-09 11:51:23	sparky[m]	your concern is with the reverse proxy first. and no, the docs arent all that linux specific. Windows has no real web/reverse proxy server software unless you are paying for Windows server
2019-09-09 11:51:37	sparky[m]	which means youll use apache or nginx on Windows as well, and they are configured the same way
2019-09-09 11:52:51	dexdeadly[m]	sparky how are you doing it?  I'm using app_gid and app_uid should I do it with just UID and GID?
2019-09-09 11:53:35	Gravity[m]	Yeah I was looking at nginx, I'll re-read over the docs on it. I didn't look much into it because I was focusing on the certificates. I do need a domain for the reverse proxy though right? I noticed on the docs and said the IP and Domain name.
2019-09-09 11:53:42	sparky[m]	<dexdeadly[m] "sparky how are you doing it?  I'"> no idea frankly... i am using ansible and im unsure of how it handles it on the backend. i just know that ive had ot pass UID and GID in and that UNAME and GNAME didnt work
2019-09-09 11:54:34	sparky[m]	yes, you need a domain for a cert but you cant get a cert from LE until the reverse proxy is setup. can also try Caddy. its arguably a lot easier (plus it automagically gets and manages the cert for you)
2019-09-09 11:55:11	sparky[m]	in fact... thinking about it, id probably just use caddy given that you are on windows. i can forsee problems with the cert in your future otherwise
2019-09-09 11:56:07	dexdeadly[m]	I'll remove app and see if it works, thats possibly it.  I know all the linuxserver dockers I use has APP_ probably where I did it
2019-09-09 11:57:16	sparky[m]	<dexdeadly[m] "I'll remove app and see if it wo"> they make custom stuff. likely has their own way of handling user accounts and what not. im just using the buil tin docke rway

2019-09-09 12:01:27	sparky[m]	yeah, its a bit confusing until your first time or two then reverse proxies are a cake walk

2019-09-09 12:01:38	Gravity[m]	Yeah I assume so
2019-09-09 12:01:41	Gravity[m]	and ok
2019-09-09 12:02:03	sparky[m]	for me the hardest part was grasping what a reverse proxy is even doing
2019-09-09 12:03:09	dexdeadly[m]	yup looks like thats what did it i removed one collection and then rescanned.  Now its comin in as root which is right

2019-09-09 12:05:10	dexdeadly[m]	and fix wee
2019-09-09 12:06:33	Gravity[m]	With the caddy install, it gives the options for plugins, and I see options for dns providers. Is there a reason to want this?
2019-09-09 12:07:15	sparky[m]	for basic use, no
2019-09-09 12:07:19	Gravity[m]	ok
2019-09-09 12:08:42	Gravity[m]	Also kinda confused on the `NAT rule matches on port -> reverse proxy matches on the hostname in the HTTP header ` part of your statement? Is it basically checking the port and then bouncing it around kinda?
2019-09-09 12:08:53	JustAMan[m]	halvor: re webos, you need to put your tv in developer mode so far. Or you can try using jf from browser

2019-09-09 12:12:42	sparky[m]	NAT is your router. it has rules that say "if traffic comes in on this port send it to this IP and this port on the LAN". its how you get from the outside to the reverse proxy
2019-09-09 12:13:09	Gravity[m]	ah
2019-09-09 12:13:13	sparky[m]	and no, you use the reverse proxy directory
2019-09-09 12:13:23	JustAMan[m]	<essasetic[m] "This looks like it would be a 11"> 11 is for major api rewrite I believe

2019-09-09 12:13:50	sparky[m]	thats a bizzare question

2019-09-09 12:14:54	sparky[m]	its the site, its a reverse proxy
2019-09-09 12:15:28	Gravity[m]	lol kinda lost, so I'm putting caddy into the nginx directory..?

2019-09-09 12:16:03	Gravity[m]	That's what I was reading from

2019-09-09 12:17:32	Gravity[m]	Ohhh
2019-09-09 12:17:35	sparky[m]	caddy should work all on its own
2019-09-09 12:18:35	Gravity[m]	So is caddy acting as a reverse proxy?

2019-09-09 12:23:01	Gravity[m]	and yeah caddy is downloaded
2019-09-09 12:23:53	Gravity[m]	Upon running, it just gives the 404 when going to that localhost page (As stated in the docs). Assume this is because it's not paired w anything

2019-09-09 12:46:05	sparky[m]	and by right, i mean yo uforward ports 80 and 443 to the IP caddy is on (keeping the ports the same)

2019-09-09 13:04:49	Gravity[m]	You said caddy generates certificates right? Why would I need 8096 forwarded btw? I thought 8096 was default for http, and 8920 was https? Would it not make sense to assign caddy to 8920 and only forward 8920?

2019-09-09 13:04:55	Gravity[m]	will fix
2019-09-09 13:05:19	sparky[m]	no... the clients only talk to caddy through 80/443
2019-09-09 13:05:21	sparky[m]	caddy talks to JF on 8096
2019-09-09 13:05:37	sparky[m]	if you want to secure the link between caddy and JF its a whole nother layer of BS
2019-09-09 13:06:15	Gravity[m]	I still need to keep 8096 and 8920 forwarded then correct?
2019-09-09 13:06:23	sparky[m]	no
2019-09-09 13:06:23	sparky[m]	no
2019-09-09 13:06:30	sparky[m]	shut both those ports on the router
2019-09-09 13:06:32	Gravity[m]	ok that makes sense
2019-09-09 13:06:35	sparky[m]	they are irrelevant now
2019-09-09 13:06:51	sparky[m]	all traffic flows through 80/443 to caddy, caddy then directs it to JF on 8096
2019-09-09 13:07:09	Gravity[m]	so basically caddy is acting as a redirect for those ports kinda?
2019-09-09 13:07:30	sparky[m]	yes. thats what a reverse proxy is
2019-09-09 13:07:58	Gravity[m]	Ok yeah I guess I only understood it partly before
2019-09-09 13:08:05	sparky[m]	the incoming traffic is sent onwards with caddy as the client
2019-09-09 13:08:14	Gravity[m]	Is opening port 443 and 80 not a vulnerability though?
2019-09-09 13:08:17	sparky[m]	then, once caddy gets teh info back it sends it to the original client
2019-09-09 13:08:19	sparky[m]	no
2019-09-09 13:08:31	sparky[m]	unless you put inscure stuff on it
2019-09-09 13:08:47	sparky[m]	its also needed for LE to get a cert. it assumes 80/443 are available and open
2019-09-09 13:08:54	Gravity[m]	Ah ok
2019-09-09 13:09:30	sparky[m]	you can change it if you want, but that means you need to do more work. usually an ACME challege using TXT records

2019-09-09 13:21:08	sparky[m]	btw, its publicly accessible insofar as they must know the domain name. just hitting the IP+port caddy lives on will result in caddy sending back something but it shouldne be a site (you can test this by browsing to your WAN IP)

2019-09-09 13:23:38	sparky[m]	so in your case, unless they have the full domain (sub.domain.tld) for a service they will only find out that something is there. no idea if they will attempt to find out more or not but thats for you to decide
2019-09-09 13:24:01	sparky[m]	basically, what kind of risk are you ok with?
2019-09-09 13:27:43	sparky[m]	anyways... you can run web servers on other machines and the reverse proxy will still work. basically lets you reuse 80/443 for everything web on your LAN as long as you keep breaking it up by subdomain or path

2019-09-09 13:29:03	sparky[m]	caddy secures the connection between itself and your client. outside your network this means that passwords and such wont be in plain text
2019-09-09 13:29:26	sparky[m]	you could intercept the domain and see what service lives there, but then they have to exploit that service to do much with that knowledge

2019-09-09 13:31:43	sparky[m]	if you only recently got this domain and set it to the IP of your WAN id think nothing of the mobile data. if its older, check that the mobile can browse to JF proper (with the domain). if it cant you screwed up something
2019-09-09 13:32:25	sparky[m]	yes.
2019-09-09 13:32:26	sparky[m]	crawling is the process of discovering subdomains. so, i myself dont have anything at my domain (you can check, its in my matrix username)
2019-09-09 13:32:29	sparky[m]	i live entirely off subdomains
2019-09-09 13:32:54	sparky[m]	the process of finding out all my subdomains isnt simple. there is no DNS framework for saying "i want all subdomains of domain"
2019-09-09 13:33:21	sparky[m]	you have to know said subdomain and ask for that subdomain specifically
2019-09-09 13:35:36	Gravity[m]	I just got the domain the other day and set it to my wan ip. But in time won't this domain get "older" anyways? And wdym by "I'd think nothing of the mobile data", are you saying don't worry about connecting on it?
2019-09-09 13:35:37	Gravity[m]	And how exactly do you even go about setting up subdomains to a domain? Is it something simple done in the domain manager, or is it a pain in the ass? Was curious if maybe I should be using subdomains instead?
2019-09-09 13:36:27	sparky[m]	so, from what i can see from your pic above you have an @ and www subdomain set already
2019-09-09 13:36:41	sparky[m]	just delete those, add a new A record and put what you want the sub part to be in that box

2019-09-09 13:37:07	minksuki[m]	uhh
2019-09-09 13:37:09	sparky[m]	as for mobile i mean if it can connect to JF using the domain but using the IP results in forever loading dont worry about it
2019-09-09 13:37:31	minksuki[m]	so my torrents downloads locally, then sonarr moves them to a cloud drive, /mnt/drive/movies, where jellyfin is supposed to read from

2019-09-09 13:37:54	sparky[m]	always use subdomains Gravity. lets you add more services later without having to break stuff
2019-09-09 13:38:28	Gravity[m]	>just delete those, add a new A record and put what you want the sub part to be in that box
2019-09-09 13:38:29	Gravity[m]	Only one of them is www, the one above it is blank in the name field.

2019-09-09 13:38:34	sparky[m]	and only use the one A record. use CNAMEs for all subsequent subdomains. makes DDNS easier
2019-09-09 13:38:39	sparky[m]	yeah, blank means @
2019-09-09 13:38:50	Gravity[m]	ah
2019-09-09 13:38:51	sparky[m]	which is basically domain.tld
2019-09-09 13:38:57	sparky[m]	and www.domain.tld
2019-09-09 13:39:05	sparky[m]	<minksuki[m] "so I just dl'd a movie and jelly"> not detecting how?
2019-09-09 13:39:17	JoshuaBoniface[m	minksuki: only thing i could think of is permissions
2019-09-09 13:39:18	minksuki[m]	<sparky[m] "not detecting how?"> it's just not showing in my library
2019-09-09 13:39:33	sparky[m]	yeah, id check perms first
2019-09-09 13:39:47	minksuki[m]	what's the default user jellyfin runs under
2019-09-09 13:39:53	sparky[m]	jellyfin
2019-09-09 13:40:45	minksuki[m]	ok
2019-09-09 13:41:12	Gravity[m]	so I delete both of those
2019-09-09 13:41:13	Gravity[m]	Add records > type a, (What to put for TIL?), target my wan ip, and for name I put the subdomain? (So something like like jellyfin. ?) So it would be jellyfin.domain.tk? Or something like that?
2019-09-09 13:41:48	minksuki[m]	what permissions do I need to give jellyfin to /mnt/movies
2019-09-09 13:41:52	sparky[m]	300 is what your registrar defaults to and its 5 minutes. basically it means that if a record changes it can take up to 5 minutes to start being reflected around the world
2019-09-09 13:41:53	minksuki[m]	or /mnt/drive
2019-09-09 13:42:11	sparky[m]	and yeah, whatever you put on that box becomes the bit before the domain.tld
2019-09-09 13:42:35	sparky[m]	read permissions at minimum for files, read+execute for folders
2019-09-09 13:43:14	minksuki[m]	rclone doesn't let me change perms
2019-09-09 13:43:34	sparky[m]	and it needs read+execure perms for all folders leading to the library. so if it cant open `/mnt` iit cant open `/mnt/drive` even if it has the perms to do so
2019-09-09 13:43:59	minksuki[m]	oh fax fax
2019-09-09 13:44:08	minksuki[m]	rclone reverts the perma

2019-09-09 13:45:52	TrueTechy[m]	<minksuki[m] "rclone reverts the perma"> rclone has defaults for file permissions but you can change them in the mount command
2019-09-09 13:46:25	minksuki[m]	wdym
2019-09-09 13:46:38	minksuki[m]	oh so I just add those arguments to the commands
2019-09-09 13:46:41	minksuki[m]	and everything should be good?
2019-09-09 13:48:05	TrueTechy[m]	Well by default it should give everyone read+write permission to files so Jellyfin should be able to see them
2019-09-09 13:48:06	sparky[m]	no... dont set stuff to 777
2019-09-09 13:48:09	sparky[m]	thats asking for trouble

2019-09-09 13:51:20	minksuki[m]	like, before you said it was bad
2019-09-09 13:51:21	minksuki[m]	though it still doesn't show in Jellyfin
2019-09-09 13:51:36	TrueTechy[m]	<minksuki[m] "though it still doesn't show in "> Did you rescan the library after the file was added?
2019-09-09 13:51:58	minksuki[m]	how do I do that?
2019-09-09 13:52:37	TrueTechy[m]	In the server dashboard, go to library, click scan all libraries
2019-09-09 13:52:51	TrueTechy[m]	then once that's done it should have found it
2019-09-09 13:53:09	minksuki[m]	oh. there it is.

2019-09-10 10:45:28	dexdeadly[m]	Whats everyone doing with LiveTV through JellyFin and Kodi?
2019-09-10 10:55:05	TrueTechy[m]	<dexdeadly[m] "Whats everyone doing with LiveTV"> I believe its not working in the addon from other users reports however we haven't had anyone look into it in depth yet, not sure we've got someone to test it either
2019-09-10 10:58:25	sparky[m]	dinki said he would test. unsure if he got around to it though
2019-09-10 10:59:05	dexdeadly[m]	I didn't seem to have an issue within the plugin.
2019-09-10 10:59:22	dinki[m]	I did install the plugin and it does work.  The question I have is are you guys saying that JF integrates with the Kodi DVR outside of the plugin?
2019-09-10 10:59:25	dexdeadly[m]	I'd like to integrate it better within the actual live tv portion of kodi but I dont know if that will be possible
2019-09-10 10:59:54	dinki[m]	I mean the plugin doesn't extend JF to the point of allowing it to be used as a DVR/PVR integration, right?
2019-09-10 11:01:15	dinki[m]	Are you guys wanting to do stuff like set recordings and that sort of thing in Kodi?
2019-09-10 11:13:43	dinki[m]	nothing?
2019-09-10 11:18:57	dexdeadly[m]	sorry I'm technically at work 🙂 it would be cool if whats in Jellyfin could show in the LiveTV section
2019-09-10 11:24:26	dinki[m]	Understood.  I don't think that's possible right now.  While JF does allow for viewing live tv from a very basic channels view, to extend this so that Kodi's PVR guide would be populated and you could set schedules and other tasks like this would require a Kodi PVR addon/plugin written specifically to integrate with JF.  This is why I use the Android TV app. All of this is to the best of my knowledge of Kodi and JF and I
2019-09-10 11:24:27	dinki[m]	am, by far, no expert on either.
2019-09-10 11:27:45	nickbert7[m]	I was at least able to build and test this addons https://github.com/escabe/pvr.jellyfin
2019-09-10 11:27:46	nickbert7[m]	But as my NextPVR setup ist not working fine, I could not test the Live TV streams. But the channels and EPG were visible within Kodi.
2019-09-10 11:29:52	dinki[m]	Wow.  Very nice.  What are you saying about NPVR?
2019-09-10 11:30:59	dexdeadly[m]	Ahhh yea, cause I know for say my homerun prime there is its own plugin to integrate into it
2019-09-10 11:31:00	dexdeadly[m]	ooohhhhh
2019-09-10 11:33:24	nickbert7[m]	NPVR via Jellyfin is not very stable. Sometimes the streams are working fine, sometimes I have only audio when playing via chrome, sometimes nothing is working.
2019-09-10 11:33:25	nickbert7[m]	I hope I will have some time for further troubleshooting in the near future.
2019-09-10 11:35:09	nickbert7[m]	Is there any public m3u I can add as tuner for tests?
2019-09-10 11:36:26	dexdeadly[m]	I might be able to get jellyfin an IPTV m3u to test if you would like
2019-09-10 11:51:26	dinki[m]	nickbert7: You can try these https://github.com/notanewbie/LegalStream   What tuner(s) are you using?  I'm guessing not HDHRs?
2019-09-10 11:54:48	nickbert7[m]	Good to know, thank you.
2019-09-10 11:54:49	nickbert7[m]	Currently I have NPVR with a DVB Sky S960 v2
2019-09-10 11:56:01	dexdeadly[m]	I have a HomeRun Prime to test and some IPTV
2019-09-10 11:56:37	dinki[m]	I ran NPVR for a year or so.  Pretty nice software.
2019-09-10 11:58:23	dinki[m]	dexdeadly: I think you can set up the HDHR to play in Kodi's PVR but you won't be able to set the recordings for JF via Kodi.  I'd use the web gui for that sort of stuff.  That's really the thing keeping me from using Kodi clients rather than Android TV
2019-09-10 12:00:23	dexdeadly[m]	Yea Its not a huge deal just run another plugin. What I run into is I use a combo of IPTV and HDHR so if Kodi could pull from JellyFin with both of them combined would be nice

2019-09-11 15:44:31	Henry151	i'm just curious; if I have a DVD in .iso form, can/does jellyfin automatically handle that nicely? or do i have to extract things like .mkv files from it or something to handle that manually myself?
2019-09-11 15:46:55	sparky[m]	maybe...? there some iso mounting code in the project but ive heard its got problems
2019-09-11 15:47:12	sparky[m]	like i think its only working on linux and if JF is run as root or something? youll have to delve in and see
2019-09-11 15:47:32	Henry151	like only works when browsing from a linux client?
2019-09-11 15:47:39	Henry151	my jellyfin is running on my debian 10 server
2019-09-11 15:48:14	Henry151	and it's not running as root, it's running as "jellyfin", but I think i could give it the permissions it needs most likely
2019-09-11 15:48:31	Henry151	cool though, to know that there is something designed to be able to do that stuff
2019-09-11 15:48:36	Henry151	i will try to get it going.
2019-09-11 15:50:55	sparky[m]	as server i think
2019-09-11 15:51:12	sparky[m]	look up emby docs on iso support. we havent touched it as far as i know, so it should work like they describe it
2019-09-11 16:25:02	Henry151	ah, funny, i am only just now realizing that jellyfin was forked from emby, if that is the case
2019-09-11 16:28:20	sparky[m]	yeah, we forked back at 3.5.2-3.5.3

2019-09-12 16:46:58	Disconsented	well that and kodi support
2019-09-12 16:49:12	JustAMan[m]	Kodi is already there
2019-09-12 16:49:28	JustAMan[m]	Anything missing from your point of view?
2019-09-12 16:50:32	JustAMan[m]	Also ppl use it with some dlna clients like vlc, cc @anthonylavado:bonifacelabs.ca
2019-09-12 16:51:21	JustAMan[m]	*use jellyfin via dlna clients on appletv
2019-09-12 16:56:40	anthonylavado	MrMC works with the local Emby sign in, and Infuse works as a DLNA client too
2019-09-12 16:57:29	dkanada[m]	<Disconsented "well that and kodi support"> yeah I heard kodi has been working great
2019-09-12 16:57:41	dkanada[m]	probably the second most popular client after web
2019-09-12 17:05:19	sparky[m]	im using kodi on my tv now instead of web. its great because it has keyboard controls
2019-09-12 17:05:32	sparky[m]	lets me be super lazy and all that. its amazing 🙂
2019-09-12 17:43:37	Kyoon	hey devs, any progress on windows installer?
2019-09-12 17:46:17	dkanada[m]	its pretty finished I think, next is adding windows and mac installers to the nightlies
2019-09-12 17:46:28	dkanada[m]	not sure about progress on that, Joshua Boniface or EraYaN might know
2019-09-12 17:51:21	Kyoon	ok nice
2019-09-12 17:51:34	Kyoon	add a note to the topic when i should be on the lookout ;]
2019-09-12 17:51:42	Kyoon	i feel bad keep asking you
2019-09-12 17:52:27	dkanada[m]	no worries haha
2019-09-12 17:52:34	dkanada[m]	its a highly requested feature
2019-09-12 17:53:00	JoshuaBoniface[m	yup it's definitely close, I believe it's building perfectly, we just need to work out getting the assets out of Azure DevOps and onto the repo server, which shouldn't e too hard

2019-09-13 02:34:55	dkanada[m]	Kyoon I think if you want to test the windows build you can download it from this url https://dev.azure.com/jellyfin-project/jellyfin/_build/results?buildId=707&view=results
2019-09-13 02:35:03	dkanada[m]	forgot it was available from the CI
2019-09-13 02:45:42	Kyoon	dkanada[m] great will do thanks
2019-09-13 02:56:55	Kyoon	dkanada[m] call me a newb but where on that page is the download lmao
2019-09-13 02:57:50	JustAMan[m]	First link? "Jellyfin server setup" maybe?
2019-09-13 03:39:23	Kyoon	JustAMan[m] got it thanks

2019-09-13 11:14:12	Kyoon	dkanada[m] just an update, it seems to install correctly except on auto-server start you have I had to hit Ignore then manually launch the nmss.exe as Run as Administrator
2019-09-13 11:14:34	Kyoon	but afterwards im not sure how to get to the dashboard...I tried launching index.html and its blank
2019-09-13 11:15:10	Kyoon	also would be nice to get a system tray icon so I can minimize nmss.exe service to the systray instead of having to keep it open in the taskbar
2019-09-13 11:15:30	Kyoon	those are my preliminary findings, hopefully that helps
2019-09-13 11:15:44	Kyoon	I can provide screenshots of anything you need
2019-09-13 11:15:52	Kyoon	OS: 64 bit Windows 10 Home (Version 10.0 1903 Build 18362.356); CPU: 4 x Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6200U CPU @ 2.30GHz @ 2400 MHz 512 KB Cache; MEM: 8083 MB, 45% (3600 MB) free; DISKS: total 918 GB - 2.30 GB free; GFX: Intel(R) HD Graphics 520 1024 MB; SCREEN: Generic PnP Monitor, 1366 x 768 @ 32 bit, 60 Hz; AUDIO: Intel(R) Display Audio; UPTIME: 1 d, 18 h, 53 m
2019-09-13 11:22:03	sparky[m]	<Kyoon "but afterwards im not sure how t"> this is expected... you need to browse to the ip and port
2019-09-13 11:22:22	sparky[m]	you cant just open the index.html in a browser. it doesnt work that way
2019-09-13 11:22:43	Kyoon	I see
2019-09-13 11:23:28	Kyoon	I was just expecting usability to be as newbie friendly as emby ;o
2019-09-13 11:23:34	sparky[m]	as for the nmss.exe window, that doesnt need hiding. it needs fixing so you dont have to go through opening a window and doin git yourself
2019-09-13 11:23:37	Kyoon	what IP do I point to?
2019-09-13 11:23:38	sparky[m]	that will make it "hodden"
2019-09-13 11:23:51	Kyoon	right
2019-09-13 11:24:01	sparky[m]	likely, 127.0.0.1 with the port being 8096
2019-09-13 11:24:17	sparky[m]	and the reason index.html doesnt work is because we inherited a mess from emby
2019-09-13 11:24:35	Kyoon	still a systray icon would be nice to indicate the service is running/show refresh status/launch dashboard .... like emby
2019-09-13 11:24:54	Kyoon	I know thats probably not happening right away and im not complaining
2019-09-13 11:25:08	anthonylavado	Hrm / when I tested the installer earlier this week (Windows 10 Enterprise), Jellyfin was installed as a service automatically, and I didn’t have any window
2019-09-13 11:25:14	Kyoon	just throwing out my 2cents for the app wishlist whenever/if possible to add in the future
2019-09-13 11:25:21	sparky[m]	they make the http server do stupid shit. it injects lines to the index.html to make it work, which is why you have to browse to it and not just double click it
2019-09-13 11:25:33	anthonylavado	Sure there was no tray icon, but I could start and stop it from the Windows Services list in Task Manager
2019-09-13 11:25:53	anthonylavado	Yeah, a tray icon is planned for the future. There’s some MS .Net updates that will make that easier
2019-09-13 11:26:07	sparky[m]	can nmss even have a systray icon? i think itd have to be a second application that just manages the service
2019-09-13 11:26:35	sparky[m]	but yeah, theres no reason to not have a systray icon except that we havent made it happen yet 🙂
2019-09-13 11:26:51	Kyoon	gotcha
2019-09-13 11:27:23	Kyoon	no complaints here, appreciate the work youre putting in getting windows usability up for newbs like me
2019-09-13 11:29:28	sparky[m]	we have long not been fans of the way JF currently is installed on Windows. we just havent been wanting to hack some mostrosity together like emby did and have been researching good options 🙂
2019-09-13 11:29:52	sparky[m]	also, almost no devs actually use windows as a server so its been slow going ☹️
2019-09-13 11:30:45	sparky[m]	glad to have folks testing it and giving feedback. just letting you know that opening the index.html is expected to result in failure and that you need to do it bt just going to the server in a browser 🙂
2019-09-13 12:57:47	Kyoon	gotcha

2019-09-13 14:41:11	fosslinux	hey all. would anyone know why when I add a playlist, it is avaliable to all users? how do i make this not the case?
2019-09-13 14:43:07	sparky[m]	help us rewrite the database so we can make playlists a proper library type rather than some BS psuedolibrary that has no access controls
2019-09-13 14:43:57	sparky[m]	unfortunately, its not your fault and currently nothing can be done. it requires some pretty structural changes. music is very much just tacked on cause emby never tried to make it good
2019-09-13 14:48:14	 - 	ksteimel[m] is now known as Kenneth[m]
2019-09-13 14:48:59	fosslinux	:X
2019-09-13 14:49:39	fosslinux	so it is also by design that other users can access libraries not given access to via playlists that another user makes, i guess?
2019-09-13 14:51:53	sparky[m]	yes, unfortunately
2019-09-13 14:51:54	sparky[m]	we dont want it that way but its a huge change to fix it
2019-09-13 14:52:01	sparky[m]	its like how you cant turn off either of the music metadata providers right now
2019-09-13 14:52:35	sparky[m]	i get the gist of why, but it basically boils down to music being bolted on currently
2019-09-13 14:52:42	sparky[m]	our rewrite is aiming to fix these shortcomings
2019-09-13 14:52:49	sparky[m]	our database rewrite*
2019-09-13 14:53:13	fosslinux	yeah i see
2019-09-13 14:53:25	fosslinux	guess ill start contributing to the jellyfin codebase, lol
2019-09-13 14:54:00	sparky[m]	if you can thatd be great! EraYaN has most of the new DB schema in place
2019-09-13 14:56:13	sparky[m]	you can get in touch with him if you wanna speed up that process so we can work on the library access bugs

2019-09-14 05:01:52	Oddstr13[m]	I just installed a fresh nightly from debian repo (no media yet)
2019-09-14 05:02:08	dkanada[m]	hlsjs is bundled separately with web now which requires a build step, which may or may not be implemented in the server
2019-09-14 05:02:26	dkanada[m]	I know nullsum fixed docker but idk what the status of the normal builds are
2019-09-14 05:02:33	Oddstr13[m]	so, web playback may not work
2019-09-14 05:03:06	Oddstr13[m]	I'll add some media and test after lunch

2019-09-14 14:40:24	JoshuaBoniface[m	that looks like you have process/user file access limits of some kind, and jellyfin hit it. can't say i've seen thatbefore

2019-09-14 17:26:25	Henry151	howdy folks
2019-09-14 17:27:05	Henry151	so, all my files are named like This\ is\ the\ Name\ of\ the\ Movie\ \(2013\).mkv
2019-09-14 17:27:33	Henry151	i just got a whole stack of movies from a friend that are named like This.is.the.Name.of.the.Movie.2013.mkv
2019-09-14 17:27:47	Henry151	now, I know how to rename them all to match my convention, i've got multiple techniques for that
2019-09-14 17:28:04	Henry151	but it's a network share type thing, so I don't want to go renaming all his files, they're his
2019-09-14 17:28:57	Henry151	so I was thinking i'd make a symlink to each of the individual files (using a little thing like for f in folder; do make symlink thing) and then rename all my symlinks
2019-09-14 17:29:13	Henry151	but, i was then thinking, maybe there's a way to tell jellyfin, "interpret these filenames this way"
2019-09-14 17:29:24	Henry151	so that they'll all display the same style even though the filenames are odd.
2019-09-14 17:31:18	Henry151	side note; i've got a TCL Roku TV, is there any functioning app or way that i could browse my jellyfin straight from the roku tv?
2019-09-14 17:59:33	thornbill[m]	There’s a Roku app in development but you have to build and install it manually currently
2019-09-14 18:21:16	sanezilla[m]	I'm trying to work on it but live tv and dvr will be the first things I do with it.
2019-09-14 18:23:21	sanezilla[m]	I record shows every day. Currently I use the fire tv app to play recordings and the hdhomerun app for live tv.
2019-09-14 18:27:35	sanezilla[m]	I wasted some time trying to get the roku eclipse stuff working. Java errors and I think it wants Sun jre 8, which I won't install.
2019-09-14 18:29:36	sanezilla[m]	So I got the roku tools for atom installed but atom has a bug which pisses me off. Works on a local desktop but not so well remotely with X11 forwarding
2019-09-14 18:32:42	sanezilla[m]	Looks okay until I try to open a file. I get a dark blank window for the open file dialog. Sometimes that leads to a crash and core dump.

2019-09-15 06:08:46	aanok[m]	hello! i'm developing a linux-only cli client for jellyfin. i don't consider it good enough yet for a public release, but would it be alright if i posted the link to a preview build here?
2019-09-15 06:09:15	aanok[m]	an archive with the source repository, that is
2019-09-15 06:10:48	branon	i'd check it out
2019-09-15 06:11:07	hypervtechnics[m	> > <@kieeps:matrix.org> Are there a way to sync stuff to the android app for offline use with jellyfin?
2019-09-15 06:11:07	hypervtechnics[m	> Not at this time. It’s our most highly-requested feature, but we’d prefer to have it inside the “future app” instead of inside the current app.
2019-09-15 06:11:08	hypervtechnics[m	Me and @fruhnow:matrix.org are planning to write a native mobile APP with an offline feature similar to Spotify
2019-09-15 06:13:00	aanok[m]	<branon "i'd check it out"> thanks. i'll just wait till a mod gives the ok. dunno how the netiquette is here for this kind of thing :)

2019-09-15 06:15:48	JustAMan[m]	We are all volunteers here, and the project is based on do-ocracy model, so no need to wait for approval - the more clients we have, the better
2019-09-15 06:16:52	dkanada[m]	<aanok[m] "hello! i'm developing a linux-on"> yes! this is what I always dreamed of
2019-09-15 06:16:57	branon	aanok[m]: just toss a link bro
2019-09-15 06:17:11	aanok[m]	alright :) have the link then https://0x0.st/zypA.zip
2019-09-15 06:17:26	aanok[m]	works on audio only so far. but it does sink progress at least
2019-09-15 06:17:26	branon	nice
2019-09-15 06:17:43	dkanada[m]	also yeah no worries about the mod approval, we're not that crazy haha
2019-09-15 06:18:02	JustAMan[m]	aanok: why not make a github repo?
2019-09-15 06:18:08	aanok[m]	it should also be pretty lightweight. i'm mostly writing it because i'm allergic to web interfaces
2019-09-15 06:18:40	JustAMan[m]	I think there's mopidy client thing
2019-09-15 06:18:41	aanok[m]	ah, i have one. i'm just keeping it private till i have a few more features (video support, essentially)
2019-09-15 06:18:52	JustAMan[m]	Why that?
2019-09-15 06:19:19	JustAMan[m]	More eyes is usually better in foss world
2019-09-15 06:19:37	dkanada[m]	eh people who would use a cli client probably only use audio anyways :p
2019-09-15 06:19:43	aanok[m]	i'll also put up an AUR PKGBUILD when i do that. i'd like the software to be a bit more decent beforehand
2019-09-15 06:20:14	aanok[m]	well, i'd use it for video too :D
2019-09-15 06:20:15	branon	audio only sounds okay
2019-09-15 06:20:16	dkanada[m]	ncurses?
2019-09-15 06:20:23	branon	if it can just pipe to mpv for video that'd be stellar
2019-09-15 06:20:40	aanok[m]	no. just straight up writes to terminal, kinda like youtube-viewer if you know that
2019-09-15 06:20:44	dkanada[m]	<branon "if it can just pipe to mpv for v"> indeed
2019-09-15 06:21:09	aanok[m]	it already uses mpv as playback backend :)
2019-09-15 06:21:09	aanok[m]	i just need to wrangke the jellyfin/emby api for video
2019-09-15 06:21:10	dkanada[m]	<aanok[m] "no. just straight up writes to t"> huh I dont, sounds interesting
2019-09-15 06:21:12	aanok[m]	 * i just need to wrangle the jellyfin/emby api for video
2019-09-15 06:21:30	aanok[m]	which is a fun magical realm
2019-09-15 06:21:31	dkanada[m]	got a screenshot?
2019-09-15 06:22:01	dkanada[m]	<aanok[m] "which is a fun magical realm"> yeah the transcoding and play profiles are kinda crazy
2019-09-15 06:22:24	branon	aanok[m]: excellent, yeah i'd like to see a git repo for this :D
2019-09-15 06:22:47	JustAMan[m]	aanok: what about utilizing libcaca for video? :D
2019-09-15 06:23:13	dkanada[m]	I like mpv, its a great client
2019-09-15 06:23:24	JustAMan[m]	Btw ffmpeg can use libcaca I believe
2019-09-15 06:23:41	aanok[m]	the interface is something like this https://pastebin.com/m408QfRD
2019-09-15 06:23:57	aanok[m]	i.e. it just delegates everything about playback to mpv
2019-09-15 06:24:44	aanok[m]	i'm trying to be as thin about that as possible. so far the only thing i'm doing differently is managing the playlist because i stream it from disk instead of using mpv's native in-memory behavior
2019-09-15 06:25:39	aanok[m]	<JustAMan[m] "aanok: what about utilizing libc"> i think mpv should have a video output driver for that, hah
2019-09-15 06:27:46	JustAMan[m]	Cannot mpv play from http url?
2019-09-15 06:28:12	aanok[m]	jftui does a lot of streaming to disk (playlist and json parsing through a sax interface), so that ultimately the overhead on top of mpv is something like 15MB. almost all of which is curl and openssl
2019-09-15 06:28:39	aanok[m]	<JustAMan[m] "Cannot mpv play from http url?"> it can, in fact all jftui does is direct play file served from the server
2019-09-15 06:28:39	dkanada[m]	what language?
2019-09-15 06:28:50	aanok[m]	pure C. because masochism
2019-09-15 06:29:00	JustAMan[m]	Lol
2019-09-15 06:29:06	dkanada[m]	oof might not be able to help out with this one haha
2019-09-15 06:29:33	dkanada[m]	I do not speak the ancient tongues
2019-09-15 06:29:48	JustAMan[m]	How 'bout Pascal?
2019-09-15 06:29:52	mcarlton[m]	branon: i'm pretty sure i've seen that kodi/subtitle issue (or at least a similar one on another format).  I had to run out of town this weekend, but hopefully i'll get to it in a few hours
2019-09-15 06:30:35	mcarlton[m]	and yes, there's a mopidy client.  my rambling mess that i'm still amazed is functional (if a bit slow at times)
2019-09-15 06:30:45	aanok[m]	i unironically would use pascal if i could. alas, there are no HTTPS libraries for it
2019-09-15 06:31:09	aanok[m]	and i cba to investigate an FFI :p
2019-09-15 06:31:34	aanok[m]	pascal is the good C
2019-09-15 06:33:39	dkanada[m]	now I'm gonna have to brush up on C so I can add ncurses
2019-09-15 06:33:57	dkanada[m]	I like cli but I'm not that masochistic
2019-09-15 06:34:30	dkanada[m]	I'll try it out first of course, maybe you'll convert me to basic text output over ncurses
2019-09-15 06:34:45	aanok[m]	well, from a dev standpoint adding ncurses would sensibly complicate things. as long as you're alright with how cli mpv behaves you'll be good
2019-09-15 06:36:45	dkanada[m]	what do you mean my three million lines of code bundled from 75 different libraries and utils adds complexity?? /s
2019-09-15 06:37:45	dkanada[m]	alas, I've seen the code for the server, destroyed any semblance of jellyfin being a "lightweight" solution haha
2019-09-15 06:39:19	aanok[m]	yeah. plex and emby are both really featureful and, from what i've gathered, the old emby codebase isn't very high quiality on top of that
2019-09-15 06:39:57	 - 	jackweatherley[m is now known as JackTheFlap[m]
2019-09-15 06:40:54	dkanada[m]	eh its either jellyfin or nfs storage imo at this point, and nfs is just a bit too barebones for me
2019-09-15 06:42:50	aanok[m]	quite. personally, what i really ultimately need is something that can track progress (watched, unwatched and mid-way bookmarks) and has some mobile clients
2019-09-15 06:43:49	aanok[m]	but afaik it's not really a sweetspot hit by any media server or other solution. it's either super barebones stuff like cherrypy or fully-featured suites like jf, subsonic or plex
2019-09-15 06:46:07	dkanada[m]	that's exactly how I feel too! Jellyfin is a bit heavy for my taste but my solution has been to slim the web client, pluginize as much as possible, and maybe write a native android app eventually
2019-09-15 06:46:52	aanok[m]	at least jf is open source and pretty actively developed :)
2019-09-15 06:48:08	dkanada[m]	there are just so many abandoned or feature lacking media servers out there, it must just be a really hard niche to fill
2019-09-15 06:49:24	aanok[m]	it's a complicated piece of software. it's a lot of work to develop
2019-09-15 07:19:15	branon	anything dotnet tends to be bignasty by extension
2019-09-15 07:19:46	branon	jellyfin is good though, it's the only free software which does what it does so it's a winner in my book

2019-09-15 09:07:16	Gravity[m]	May be a stupid question, but is Jellyfin capable of direct streaming vc1? It doesn't seem so as it's transcoding it says in the playback info.
2019-09-15 09:07:17	Gravity[m]	When I stream from  jellyfin my gpu usage goes really high, but when I just play the file through mpv on my computer it sits really low. I was wondering if my computer can play it fine, and even though Jellyfin has to stream it, why wouldn't it be able to direct play it? Seeing it's using mpv as well? Lmao
2019-09-15 09:11:02	sparky[m]	Your computer is NOT the same as the client
2019-09-15 09:11:37	sparky[m]	If the client can't, it'll transcode even if the hardware can
2019-09-15 09:12:51	sparky[m]	And as far as I know, JF has no mpv backed clients that can do video
2019-09-15 09:13:19	Gravity[m]	<sparky[m] "And as far as I know, JF has no "> wdym by this
2019-09-15 09:17:54	sparky[m]	> Seeing it's using mpv as well?
2019-09-15 09:17:55	sparky[m]	JF doesn't use mpv in any of the official clients (as far as I know) and the only mpv backed unofficial client is music only if I'm not mistaken
2019-09-15 09:18:30	sparky[m]	Basically, I'm not following along with your assertions and as such, am unsure of how to answer/help

2019-09-15 09:44:50	anthonylavado	No MPV in any of the released clients.
2019-09-15 09:45:27	anthonylavado	In your GitHub issue, you indicated you’re using Android TV. Right now that uses ExoPlayer (kind of), and there’s an option for VLC.
2019-09-15 09:46:13	anthonylavado	IIRC the main issue with the Android TV client (even when used on Fire TV) is that it tries to direct play everything, and doesn’t request a transcode when it should
2019-09-15 09:46:50	anthonylavado	Regarding on the computer, yeah, the browsers will request a transcode properly
2019-09-15 09:47:49	anthonylavado	Now that said, I think there was some work on getting MPV in the electron/theatre app, but that’s currently stalled
2019-09-15 09:50:07	JustAMan[m]	Iirc there was no direct work, rather wishes to do so
2019-09-15 09:50:28	JustAMan[m]	But I haven't followed electron client closely of late
2019-09-15 09:51:31	JustAMan[m]	Maybe guys who wanted to make a c#/xamarin client would be able to make a desktop standalone one.
2019-09-15 09:51:32	JustAMan[m]	Or you can try using desktop Kodi
2019-09-15 11:08:16	hypervtechnics[m	Can I run both jellyfin and emby on the same server in parallel?
2019-09-15 11:09:40	*	JoshuaBoniface[m sent a long message:  < https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/v1/download/matrix.org/oKJZeLgySHzvMgoFlKzsRaEN >
2019-09-15 11:11:05	JoshuaBoniface[m	note though that the `.deb` packages explicitly conflict with Emby `.deb` packages due to this. If you just want to test out Jellyfin and use Emby via `.deb` packages, use the generic Linux portable version instead (https://repo.jellyfin.org/releases/server/linux)
2019-09-15 11:14:49	hypervtechnics[m	Thank you. Only want to use it as test and dev instance for a client. Emby is current "prod". No time to do the migration yet.
2019-09-15 11:15:45	hypervtechnics[m	Are the bugfixes fixed after 3.5.2 in emby somehow included in Jellyfin?

2019-09-15 11:18:43	JoshuaBoniface[m	some might be, if we found them and fixed them, but it's a hard fork and we have no access to any Emby code after 3.5.3 so it depends ont he specific issue

2019-09-15 11:57:49	aanok[m]	that is the way it behaves for me too. but if you read the docs, the guarantee is for files with multiple versions to be presented as a single items, not split in multiple parts
2019-09-15 11:58:50	aanok[m]	(the old emby api about that is pretty stupid imho. it's one endpoint to get general metadata and the first part, then another to get the additional parts)

2019-09-15 13:27:27	branon	multiple versions is covered further down
2019-09-15 13:27:29	branon	https://branon.me/files/YjJjYWY.png
2019-09-15 13:28:23	branon	judging from the listing given at the top, multi-disc movies should be matched as a single item when named with CDx
2019-09-15 13:30:24	aanok[m]	indeed. i agree one would expect split files to be presented as a single item (that's how plex does it, for instance), but that's not a guarantee stated in the docs
2019-09-15 13:30:51	branon	i guess i misunderstand why Film (2010) is a directory, with Film-cd1.avi and Film-cd2.avi inside of it
2019-09-15 13:30:57	aanok[m]	so i wouldn't really call it a bug. but as a feature request i think it makes perfect sense
2019-09-15 13:31:03	branon	why show that if not to imply that they're matched together
2019-09-15 13:31:20	branon	you wouldn't use one without the other
2019-09-15 13:31:48	aanok[m]	well, they are. in fact you find an Additional Part thingo on the web interface's page for the movie
2019-09-15 13:32:12	aanok[m]	it does recognize they belong together. just presents them in an odd manner
2019-09-15 13:32:14	branon	sure but that shows up for any other file in that movie's directory irrespective of filename
2019-09-15 13:32:22	branon	it doesn't really
2019-09-15 13:32:35	branon	if it recognized that, it would play the Additional Part(s) after the main file
2019-09-15 13:32:42	branon	and not just think it has a 50 minute long movie
2019-09-15 13:33:28	aanok[m]	that would be pretty natural, i agree
2019-09-15 13:34:01	aanok[m]	but alternative versions of the same file don't come up as Additional Parts for me. they generate a dropdown menu
2019-09-15 13:34:21	branon	alternate versions is entirely distinct from this
2019-09-15 13:35:02	aanok[m]	<branon "sure but that shows up for any o"> err, i thought that was what you were referencing with this
2019-09-15 13:35:25	aanok[m]	let me double check
2019-09-15 13:35:49	branon	depends on the specific naming which triggers an "alternate version" vs. "additional part"
2019-09-15 13:36:08	branon	for versions i'm guessing it's `Movie Name - Version.ext`
2019-09-15 13:36:11	branon	with a hyphen
2019-09-15 13:37:50	branon	the point of the issue is that half the movie shouldn't really be lumped into an additional part, without metadata, that won't be played after the first half
2019-09-15 13:38:03	branon	not to mention it's completely inaccessible to clients like kodi
2019-09-15 13:39:09	aanok[m]	and i agree with the point! it's just not a bug, only bad UI. and that's kodi's fault for not using the api as it should :p
2019-09-15 13:39:30	aanok[m]	the scanner and database are working as intended. the web client is just being counterintuitive, that's all
2019-09-15 13:39:52	branon	i disagree with your claim that this is intended
2019-09-15 13:40:05	branon	so if i'm watching a multi-disc movie, the intent is for it to cut out completely half way through
2019-09-15 13:40:19	branon	and require the user to scroll down and click on an additional part without metadata, title or poster
2019-09-15 13:41:32	aanok[m]	the scanner and database are working as they should. i'm gonna guess as far as the web client goes, the feature got implemented halfway through back then and then kinda abandoned
2019-09-15 13:41:44	aanok[m]	you did open the issue in the server repo :p
2019-09-15 13:41:57	branon	again, how is that possible
2019-09-15 13:42:02	branon	no client implements this properly then
2019-09-15 13:42:06	branon	?
2019-09-15 13:42:33	aanok[m]	not until i'm done with jftui, lol
2019-09-15 13:42:40	branon	i hate to draw comparisons to plex/emby but this is handled by the server when using those softwares
2019-09-15 13:42:50	branon	the server scans multi-disc and presents them as a single item, transparently
2019-09-15 13:43:03	aanok[m]	the downside to having all clients share the same web code is that one same shortcoming will come up in all clients
2019-09-15 13:43:03	branon	any client is automatically switched from one disc to the next during playback
2019-09-15 13:43:12	branon	hmm
2019-09-15 13:43:18	branon	this still does not seem right though
2019-09-15 13:43:21	branon	what about the runtime display?
2019-09-15 13:43:27	aanok[m]	plex does not do that. the api presents multiple parts and the clients handle them
2019-09-15 13:43:39	branon	let me guess: client's responsibility to concatenate runtime from multiple files
2019-09-15 13:43:46	branon	ahh, i think i get it
2019-09-15 13:43:57	branon	well that's disappointing
2019-09-15 13:44:05	aanok[m]	that's how it worked in plex, yeah
2019-09-15 13:44:20	aanok[m]	yeah it's a bit convoluted
2019-09-15 13:45:57	branon	well. until there exists a client that can (at the very least) traverse files during playback i can't watch any of my multi-disc rips
2019-09-15 13:46:14	branon	not to mention calculating runtime accurately, and ideally hiding additional parts by default for multi-disc
2019-09-15 13:46:57	aanok[m]	there are a few tricky bits to take care of, yeah. it's part of why i've been delaying implementing video. i do plan to have all that
2019-09-15 13:47:39	aanok[m]	because, as you say, that's how you'd expect things to work
2019-09-15 13:48:01	JustAMan[m]	I feel that jf can "direct stream" concatenated parts via single url
2019-09-15 13:48:09	JustAMan[m]	Or rather, "jf _should_"
2019-09-15 13:50:22	aanok[m]	i don't think it can, but it's been a while since i've looked into it
2019-09-15 13:50:50	aanok[m]	pretty sure all parts have their own distinct id, which is essentially what you query on to handle streams
2019-09-15 13:51:17	JustAMan[m]	It's pretty easy to concat using ffmpeg, so that's why I say "jf should"
2019-09-15 13:57:13	aanok[m]	iirc there are plans to rework the API at some point, right? i'd imagine this kind of feature would come up together with that
2019-09-15 13:57:25	aanok[m]	 * iirc there are plans to rework the restful API at some point, right? i'd imagine this kind of feature would come up together with that
2019-09-15 14:00:30	JustAMan[m]	There are wishes, not exactly plans
2019-09-15 14:00:33	JustAMan[m]	But yeah
2019-09-15 15:41:49	minksuki[m]	what are the best rclone flags
2019-09-15 15:42:00	minksuki[m]	allow-other, what else
2019-09-15 15:54:20	JustAMan[m]	--help?
2019-09-15 15:55:19	JustAMan[m]	Best flag ever for almost any *nix command line thing

2019-09-17 06:12:37	sparky[m]	i think it happens once a month and kicks users that are inactive at that time for over X days or something

2019-09-17 06:45:22	vurpo	You don't have to format or reinstall if you just download their virtual machine image and get the file from inside there

2019-09-17 14:46:10	sparky[m]	sonarr, radarr, lidarr, and bazarr id guess
2019-09-17 14:46:16	sparky[m]	since they are all similar in nature
2019-09-17 14:46:21	anthonylavado	I was planning to do so, yes, but for a different reason - it was for the eventual API change
2019-09-17 14:46:42	anthonylavado	but yes, I would agree with sparky 's list, and also toss in OMBI, HASS, etc
2019-09-17 14:46:43	anthonylavado	basically, everything
2019-09-17 14:46:57	sparky[m]	probably also mrmc and whatever that fancy remote control was
2019-09-17 14:47:45	JustAMan[m]	My point was, we probably want a list and then to get in touch with them
2019-09-17 14:47:57	JustAMan[m]	To give them a heads up
2019-09-17 14:48:09	sparky[m]	yeah... it is useful to have a list and ways to contact each
2019-09-17 14:48:13	sparky[m]	makes it easier for them and us

2019-09-17 14:53:22	JustAMan[m]	Anything we missed? That filebot or something similar?
2019-09-17 14:55:52	sparky[m]	lots of plugin devs. not sure if they count since its not the HTTP API
2019-09-17 14:56:06	sparky[m]	but might be nice to be able to contact them and say "hey, we noticed your plugin is no longer building due to changes we made"
2019-09-17 14:56:15	sparky[m]	cause we CI test even 3rd party plugins right?
2019-09-17 14:57:39	JustAMan[m]	We ci plugins? That's news to me...

2019-09-18 02:40:24	JustAMan[m]	What's "og"?
2019-09-18 02:41:17	cvium[m]	radarr is a fork of sonarr
2019-09-18 02:41:42	cvium[m]	and JustAMan https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=OG
2019-09-18 05:03:51	JoshuaBoniface[m	<JustAMan[m] "What's "og"?"> "original gangster", i.e. the first one
2019-09-18 05:04:23	JoshuaBoniface[m	yea, Sonarr was first. Radarr forked it to add TV support, then Bazarr/Lidarr forked Radarr to do subtitles/music respectively
2019-09-18 05:07:28	makarai[m]	and they all work quite well
2019-09-18 05:07:48	JoshuaBoniface[m	for certain definitions of "well" :P
2019-09-18 05:08:09	JoshuaBoniface[m	my buddy and I had to hack ours up to add custom profiles, and they're buggy AF, but they do the job most of the time
2019-09-18 05:08:43	JoshuaBoniface[m	both have a bug where if you lose connection to your tracker, you have to manually "test" the connection again for it to clear, which is heckin' dumb
2019-09-18 05:38:43	cvium[m]	I gave up on lidarr. It kept scanning the entire library every night which took hours with 100% CPU usage
2019-09-18 05:39:05	cvium[m]	And its matching was awful
2019-09-18 05:52:21	JoshuaBoniface[m	haha yea, i notice they're all ram hogs too
2019-09-18 05:52:22	JoshuaBoniface[m	the way i set it up, they don't even have visibility into the library
2019-09-18 05:52:36	JoshuaBoniface[m	i basically use them just for the "take input from Ombi, download it" portion, everything after that is handled by a script
2019-09-18 05:52:56	JoshuaBoniface[m	and i'm debating rewriting that portion in python too
2019-09-18 05:58:22	JustAMan[m]	What's ombi?
2019-09-18 05:59:14	JoshuaBoniface[m	https://ombi.io/
2019-09-18 05:59:25	JoshuaBoniface[m	it's a front-end to request media for Lidarr/Sonarr/etc.
2019-09-18 05:59:58	JoshuaBoniface[m	it ties into Emby (and JF as long as we keep Emby compat) and Plex to get a list of your library contents (and users too), then lets users request media you don't have, approve/dismiss requests, and such
2019-09-18 06:00:19	JoshuaBoniface[m	we set it up for my buddy's wife to request things, but it ended up being so nice it's all I use now 😆
2019-09-18 06:00:36	JoshuaBoniface[m	with my chain, i basically just request something in here and in a few hours it's automagicaly in the library
2019-09-18 06:01:59	JoshuaBoniface[m	well, except when Sonarr/Radarr break 🤣
2019-09-18 06:02:13	dkanada[m]	<JoshuaBoniface[m "well, except when Sonarr/Radarr "> too real
2019-09-18 06:02:30	dkanada[m]	I spend more time using Sonarr than I would to just get things normally sometimes
2019-09-18 06:03:08	JoshuaBoniface[m	the irony is despite them being C# too, and me being able to hack my way trhough them, when they break i just yell at my budy to fix them :haha
2019-09-18 06:03:24	dkanada[m]	does he work on them?
2019-09-18 06:03:39	JoshuaBoniface[m	not officially no, but he hacked htem up to work with his insane quality requirements, so

2019-09-20 19:52:13	_Raijin	I'm on version 10.3.7. It got stuck on a Custom CSS theme and does not change even when I delete it and try a built in theme
2019-09-20 20:09:15	_Raijin	dinki[m] thornbill[m] Is there a way to restart the server from the menu? I see the shutdown option but I'm running docker compose so I would have to restart the whole thing
2019-09-20 20:12:58	fosslinux	There is not
2019-09-20 20:19:22	thornbill[m]	You can restart individual services in docker-compose (docker-compose restart service_name)
2019-09-20 20:23:18	_Raijin	Great, I'll give that a shot
2019-09-20 22:00:10	randomacts[m]	<_Raijin "dinki thornbill[m] Is there a wa"> On windows (at least for me) it is bugged so clicking shutdown acts similar to a restart of the service. It doesn't behave the exact same as going to the task manager and restarting the service but it still shuts down and brings it back up. Good enough for getting plugins loaded after installing lol

2019-09-22 02:58:01	dkanada[m]	hmmm I think you need to sync it or something, but when you open kodi it should autosync

2019-09-22 03:42:18	TrueTechy[m]	<greentq[m] "Hey guys, just added a movie to "> Kodi should automatically sync with jellyfin any new content added to the server, though some people have reported issues with this whilst with others it works fine.

2019-09-22 03:48:00	ChiefMedicalOffi	Couple of questions guys:
2019-09-22 03:48:00	ChiefMedicalOffi	1. Does anyone use screenplay on WebOS (LGTV)?
2019-09-22 03:48:01	ChiefMedicalOffi	2. Are the onscreen controls and settings available for you [play, pause etc]?
2019-09-22 03:55:58	greentq[m]	TrueTechy, the "Update library" Starts scanning everything, and doesn't look only for the new movies on kodi, which is not ideal.
2019-09-22 03:58:25	TrueTechy[m]	You should be able to just select your movies library. Your right it's not ideal we are looking into the sync code to determine where the problem is. Just need the time
2019-09-22 03:59:18	greentq[m]	Maybe i need Kodi companion for the update to be quick / automatic? Can someone tell me where the plugins folder is? and where i can get the kodi companion plugin to add it to jellyfin ?( I'm updating manually )
2019-09-22 03:59:56	TrueTechy[m]	You should be able to install the companion plugin from the plugin catalogue on the server dashboard
2019-09-22 04:00:16	greentq[m]	Thanks Techy :) Loving Jellyfin, it's a mild inconvenience, but not disruptive
2019-09-22 04:00:45	greentq[m]	Yes i'm aware, but no internet connection on server pc, which is why i was wondering where i can get companion, and where the plugin server is to do it manually.
2019-09-22 04:04:41	greentq[m]	And can someone tell me what the complanion plug in is named as on the catalogue?
2019-09-22 04:12:15	TrueTechy[m]	You should be able to copy the plugin folder from another server if you've got it installed there, I'm not sure too familiar with how the plugin system works. It's called Kodi Sync Queue in the general section
2019-09-22 04:12:30	greentq[m]	Awesome! Thanks super!
2019-09-22 04:20:31	ChiefMedicalOffi	Thanks man.
2019-09-22 04:21:07	dkanada[m]	<greentq[m] "Yes i'm aware, but no internet c"> the plugins are served as regular zip files from repo.jellyfin.org
2019-09-22 04:21:26	dkanada[m]	so you can just go there and download it manually if you want

2019-09-22 06:39:59	ChiefMedicalOffi	I noticed in the settings you can toggle the controls for some reason. So I can get play and pause but that's really it. Very limited. Thanks anyway mate.

2019-09-22 10:22:20	qurqar[m]	If anyone else has a better Debian path I am all ears, well beside using Debian and only Debian
2019-09-22 10:22:30	qurqar[m]	I mean package wise
2019-09-22 10:23:00	JoshuaBoniface[m	nope, but i take the opposite approach and prefer stability day-to-day, so ;-)
2019-09-22 10:26:31	iotku[m]	Debian stable for servers for no drama, fedora/arch for day-to-day systems I physically interact with and don't mind breaking (not that they do)
2019-09-22 10:26:43	iotku[m]	in a few years I'll have to remember the dist-upgrade command
2019-09-22 10:27:53	qurqar[m]	both are fair points, Debian is stable for sure as long as you do not build custom libs, install non repo apps
2019-09-22 10:28:16	iotku[m]	Main weak point with debian is that packaging isn't very intuitive imo
2019-09-22 10:28:22	qurqar[m]	Debian's own repo is fairly dry and boring :)
2019-09-22 10:28:29	iotku[m]	leads to just saying forget it and building stuff outside of the package management
2019-09-22 10:28:32	iotku[m]	which works out fine until it does

2019-09-22 20:46:33	_Raijin	Generally, yes. But I would have no issues streaming the same thing from netflix, hulu
2019-09-22 20:47:11	JoshuaBoniface[m	streaming out your WAN is severely limited by your internet conncetions upstream bandwidth, which is probably in the range of 1-20Mbps
2019-09-22 20:47:32	JoshuaBoniface[m	as opposed to Netflix, Etc. which are hosted on clouds all over the place with hundreds of gigabits f bandwidth
2019-09-22 20:48:01	JoshuaBoniface[m	you'd usually only need HA if you're noticing extreme CPU usage on the server running it, and it can't play back anything anywhere
2019-09-22 20:49:01	dkanada[m]	> 20Mbps
