2019-08-11 15:09:08	_Raijin	Hey guys, I have a quick question about downloading. I have Sonarr hooked up to SABnzbd and about 6 indexers. I can add series to my library, and even download single episodes manually. My question is: is there a way to mass download the back catalog for shows that have been airing for years so I can add them to my media collection?

2019-08-11 15:38:33	+Nelluk	_Raijin: sure, you just have to set the 'monitoring' status for the shows to how you want it, ie all seasons or current season
2019-08-11 15:46:32	_Raijin	Nelluk: I Have the "Toggle Monitor state for entire series" checked. Every episode has the solid bookark symbol. Where else would I find the setting?
2019-08-11 15:47:38	+Nelluk	well if all the episodes you want are monitored (and the shows themselves are monitored) next step would be to go Wanted > Search All or similar
2019-08-11 15:50:10	_Raijin	Hm, I tried that earlier and it didn't work, but when I just selected 5 episodes manually and clicked search it worked and sent them to sab. I'll keep tinkering, thanks

2019-08-11 16:11:15	+Nelluk	man im getting all sorts of permissions issues after a recent windows 10 update
2019-08-11 16:11:48	+Nelluk	first i couldnt start sonarr at all and had to fix the perms for that, but still couldnt run as a service until i added Network Service user with perms to the sonarr folder. and now that that works, it cant access my root media directory, which is just a local folder

2019-08-11 16:26:31	_zoggy_	worst show to manually search for: "I AM..."
2019-08-11 16:26:53	_zoggy_	pretty much pointless to try and do string searches with
2019-08-11 16:27:46	_zoggy_	also kills v3 manual search page when trying to apply filters due to how many results you get back
2019-08-11 16:32:24	_zoggy_	markus101, so on manual search you cant really sort the exceptions column. you can click on it but it only does asc sort?

2019-08-12 14:22:53	_Raijin	I'm having a slight issue with my sonar + SABnzbd pipeline. I have Sonarr connected to indexers and SAB, and I can start downloading files manually. I am running both applications in docker. As per the documentation, I mapped my Downloads folder to /downloads on both containers. then, I mapped my actual TV show directory to /tv for sonarr. This would be the folder I point my media server to to scan for media.
2019-08-12 14:22:53	_Raijin	When I download something, it goes as expected. I see a new folder in my TV shows directory with Series/Season #/Episode. However, my sonarr container continually spits out the error "Import failed, path does not exist or is not accessible by Sonarr: /downloads/TV/Season/Season #/Episode" for every downloaded episode. Why is sonarr looking for files in this location? I can "scan" the series and it will
2019-08-12 14:22:53	_Raijin	recognize I have the episode downloaded. I tried starting over with a fresh sonarr config and the issue persists. If I am understanding things right, the /downloads directory is just somewhere files live before being sorted into the TV directory?

2019-08-13 08:05:31	Ether_Man	accessing something, is not the only right sonarr requires though. Nor does 777 guarantee it has all those rights as you have additional stuff involved as well such as apparmor and so on.
2019-08-13 08:06:26	Cheez	ACL is usually a pita with it.
2019-08-13 08:06:46	Cheez	took me ages on my current build to get facls working properly
2019-08-13 08:07:37	Ether_Man	I've never really understood the point of apparmor myself... If you don't want an app to access a location... Why are you giving the user running that app access to that location in the first place? Why give it access to something, only to now require a separate solution to take that access away again? >_<
2019-08-13 08:09:44	Ether_Man	I also hate the various *nix based ACL systems because they usually run on top of the *nix permissions so just introduces a new level of permissions. Which is also part of the reason I hate container systems like docker :)

2019-08-13 15:59:38	SeepingN	that immediately disqualifies many installations
2019-08-13 15:59:55	patroner	That I can actually
2019-08-13 16:00:40	SeepingN	it's good for puting a link to the file where you want it while leaving one in the torrent directory so it can finish being shared
2019-08-13 16:00:53	SeepingN	and "deleting" one link doesn't delete the file forever
2019-08-13 16:01:04	patroner	but it seems like it can't be in the same folder as media
2019-08-13 16:01:37	SeepingN	the 2nd "copy" (link) gets created in yoru final media folder
2019-08-13 16:01:46	patroner	and plex supports this?
2019-08-13 16:01:53	SeepingN	and 1st link stays in your active download folder
2019-08-13 16:02:00	SeepingN	it's a sonar feature not plex
2019-08-13 16:02:01	SeepingN	;)
2019-08-13 16:02:24	SeepingN	plex sees the new video and moves along as usual. plex should NOT be looking into your active downloads folder(s)!
2019-08-13 16:02:24	patroner	yes, but these "links" are they actual files or ?
2019-08-13 16:02:28	patroner	Im  not quite getting it
2019-08-13 16:03:10	mtl	think of them as other names for a file
2019-08-13 16:03:15	patroner	ah, okay
2019-08-13 16:03:18	SeepingN	a file is a chunk of blocks with data in it, and a pointer ("inode" in unix/linux speak). 1 file may have 2 or more links from different directories
2019-08-13 16:03:25	mtl	if you delete all links it's gone
2019-08-13 16:03:58	SeepingN	but only until you delete them all. it's like the 2nd or 3rd column on an "ls -l" listing. usually "1" is there

2019-08-13 22:39:22	Ether_Man	I think in the case of windows (which the screenshots imply), hard links are also not all that particularly well handled in the frontend. It works just fine in the backend but the UI can give some pretty weird ass results- At least up until W8. Like, have a drive, put two linked files on it, and check space used on the drive. It'll be as expected. However, put them in different folders and check the size of the folders, it now thinks
2019-08-13 22:39:23	Ether_Man	it takes double because suddenly, the fact that they were hard links is something it just "forgot".

2019-08-14 02:05:47	Cheez	it's an ntfs thing not a windows thing, windows doesn't really understnad it. Same way ntfs is case sensitive and windows does all sorts of tricks to make it not case sensitive. or that there are multiple metadata stores for a file in ntfs and windows only uses one of them, so you can put things into the other that windows will never see but other operating systems that understand ntfs can.
2019-08-14 02:06:07	Cheez	ntfs is quite a big thing all on its own

2019-08-14 06:00:28	Ether_Man	It also implements some things incorrectly. Like, NTFS actually has a 255 char limit. But Explorer implements that as a 255 byte limit hilariously enough. NTFS itself supports a wide range of chars in the names, that Explorer says no to and stuff like that. It's kind of funny in a way, but also very very annoying :)

2019-08-14 10:21:49	fryfrog	FWIW, hard links in Linux have the same oddness. Tools that look at *file* usage will report weirdly, like `du` while tools that report *filesystem* usage are correct, like `df`.
2019-08-14 10:22:34	fryfrog	And hard links are mildly difficult to discern, you have to look at the inode to see they're the same or the "links" to see that there are more than one "file" pointed at it.
2019-08-14 10:23:02	fryfrog	And you can't just pick a random file w/ a link and find the *other* file super easy :/

2019-08-14 14:07:22	maddawg2	not sure anyone in radarr ever actually responds lol
2019-08-14 14:07:44	maddawg2	i'm having an interesting issue in radarr after trying to install it on Ubuntu 18.04 Server
2019-08-14 14:08:07	maddawg2	it's not able to map any of my movies
2019-08-14 14:08:10	maddawg2	Couldn't map movie A Dog's Way Home to a movie on The Movie DB. It will not be added :(: Unexpected character encountered while parsing value: b. Path '', line 0, position 0.
2019-08-14 14:08:20	maddawg2	not sure why :-\
2019-08-14 14:08:31	maddawg2	interestingly it's working fine on another machine i have
2019-08-14 14:08:39	maddawg2	running ubuntu 18.04
2019-08-14 14:10:45	fryfrog	maddawg2: where are you asking for radarr stuff?
2019-08-14 14:10:48	fryfrog	Discord?
2019-08-14 14:10:59	fryfrog	TMDB's api is down.

2019-08-14 14:15:37	pdickey	Hi folks, I'm having an issue with sonarr that I'm not sure how to debug any further. It's no longer importing downloaded episodes, with a log message that says "Couldn't import episode /path/to/episode.mkv: Access to the path is denied.", except I haven't made any permissions changes, and I'm able to access those files just fine as the user sonarr is running as...
2019-08-14 14:17:40	pdickey	On top of that, it's successfully copying the files, but it just thinks that it's failed. The files are mostly renamed and copied, but they're named *.mkv.partial~
2019-08-14 14:18:04	pdickey	The md5sum for the .partial~ file matches the md5sum for the file being imported.
2019-08-14 14:24:31	maddawg2	fryfrog, thanks for that info
2019-08-14 14:24:36	maddawg2	that's prob why it's not working
2019-08-14 14:24:41	maddawg2	wonder if there's a workaround :-\

2019-08-14 15:01:40	pdickey	For completeness, I'm running sonarr version 2.0.0.5322 and Mono version 6.0.0.319, which I believe are the latest stable versions of both
2019-08-14 15:10:01	@Taloth	mono 6.0 is pretty broken.
2019-08-14 15:11:47	pdickey	I see, so the guidance here is "use the latest mono, but not TOO latest" ?
2019-08-14 15:12:21	@Taloth	only workaround right now is to downgrade to 5.20, which is possible but a bit tricky. afaik it boils down to uninstalling mono and using the mono snapshot repository.
2019-08-14 15:12:21	@Taloth	You can also wait a few days, see if someone can reproduce it and provide us with more details about what is happening exactly and how to reproduce it.
2019-08-14 15:15:14	pdickey	I have a hunch, but no clue how to dig in to verify. If I do a manual mv to move the file between these two filesystems (ext4 and vboxsf/NTFS), I get an error about being unable to preserve times and permissions. The file moves, but it throws a permissions error
2019-08-14 15:20:18	pdickey	I also have stack traces, but didn't want to try to include a whole bunch of info where 99% of it was irrelevant.
2019-08-14 15:20:59	@Taloth	wait, you can reproduce it outside of sonarr?
2019-08-14 15:21:23	@Taloth	no, nvm, that's something different
2019-08-14 15:22:44	pdickey	I can't repro sonarr's error. I can get an error while doing a 'mv /path/to/file /media/sf_tvshows/file', but that command also does what it says on the box and moves the file
2019-08-14 15:22:56	pdickey	it just throws an error about being unable to preserve permissions / times
2019-08-14 15:23:18	pdickey	I know that's not sonarr's issue to solve, but it's been going on for a while and sonarr has been working fine.
2019-08-14 15:25:18	pdickey	that said, from what I can see, it looks like sonarr is doing something more like 'cp /path/to/file /media/sf_tvshows/file.partial~ && mv /media/sf_tvshows/file.partial~ /media/sf_tvshows/file'
2019-08-14 15:25:33	@Taloth	yes, the bug in sonarr is caused by mono, but I couldn't repro it in a vm easily, so waiting for third parties to get us a good reproduction scenario in some docker containers so we can try find a workaround.
2019-08-14 15:26:44	@Taloth	actually 'file hardlink to file.backup~'  then 'move file.backup~ to target.partial~' then 'rename target.partial~ to target' and finally 'delete file'
2019-08-14 15:27:16	@Taloth	it's part of a transaction maneuvre to avoid dataloss in some edge-cases.
2019-08-14 15:27:43	pdickey	that makes a ton of sense!
2019-08-14 15:28:31	pdickey	yeah, so the 'move file.backup~ to target.partial~' is successfully moving the file, but throwing an error along the way
2019-08-14 15:28:53	@Taloth	yes, with trace level logs you can see which of the 4 steps fail.
2019-08-14 15:29:38	@Taloth	iirc it's the third one, could be timing. I don't even know if it happens all the time, but I think I heard someone say that if he tried the import again then it sometimes worked.
2019-08-14 15:32:43	pdickey	I've seen this fail quite reliably today at least, and have not had a successful import in the last 10 days
2019-08-14 15:33:02	pdickey	which, I would wager decent money, is probably when I upgraded to mono 6.0
2019-08-14 15:37:12	@Taloth	I'm not gonna take that bet. :)
2019-08-14 15:38:44	@Taloth	I'd love to dive into it further, but not today.
2019-08-14 15:41:33	fryfrog	pdickey: the other way to solve it is to make it so you can atomic move / hard link.
2019-08-14 15:41:58	pdickey	not sure how that's even possible across filesystems
2019-08-14 15:42:01	fryfrog	That generally means getting the download client to do the post download move to somewhere *near* the library, then letting sonarr do an atomic move / hard link to get it in place.
2019-08-14 15:42:55	pdickey	aah that makes sense -- have the d/l client put it on the correct fs, then let sonarr put it in place
2019-08-14 15:43:38	fryfrog	Exactly, I don't use SMB but I do this for *torrents* and hard links... went ahead and made the usenet do the same thing, just for consistancy.
2019-08-14 15:44:42	pdickey	Thanks for the advice. I need to run for now, but I'll ponder on my options and choose one (downgrade to 5.20, or stick completed downloads on the other filesystem)

2019-08-24 15:36:46	_Raijin	You're lucky I guess. Family Guy, American Dad, Archer, SpongeBob, and more have wildly innacurate listings on TVdb. These are pretty popular shows so I just figured more people would have run into this
2019-08-24 15:39:18	HJL	popular meaning higher number of people...meaning more disagreements.  Ya, those I dont watch.  Sorry about your luck man, I hope someone gets organized.  Sounds like herding cats

2019-08-24 16:00:27	keith	If that's 'pretty much every show' to you maybe you should expand your viewing habits :)

2019-08-25 09:51:06	_zoggy_	yeah that one aligns with tvdb, so no fix is really needed
2019-08-25 09:51:13	_zoggy_	the only release that is 'wrong' is hdtv aired
2019-08-25 09:51:58	_zoggy_	the web ones are fine. so either we fix hdtv and break web (then breaks the rest of the season for other web releases)
2019-08-25 09:52:33	_zoggy_	so the easy fix for you is just to skip hdtv quality (or block crimson releases)

2019-08-25 10:56:03	TwoLiter	Hello, quick question; Sonarr normally adds an entire season when i click the search glass stating "Search for monitored episodes in Season X" It would normally search my trackers list, and either add a download for an entire season torrent, or add them all one by one to my bit torrent client (in this case deluge). I have tweaked my Profiles and Qu
2019-08-25 10:56:04	TwoLiter	ality Size limits and im curious if that is why i no longer have this functionality. I've been testing for the past couple hours with no luck. Does anyone have ideas, or maybe steps that I could follow in order to debug further?
2019-08-25 10:58:38	_zoggy_	using sonarr v2 or v3?

2019-09-15 11:32:59	+Nelluk	with windows, between running as a service or running as a regular app as startup, is one considered best practice?
2019-09-15 11:33:20	+Nelluk	i cant remember why i switched from startup app to service, but i think i had a reason. but i keep running into persmissions issues and cant decide if its worth trying to really solve them, or switch back
2019-09-15 11:34:03	Makere	I would run it as a service
2019-09-15 11:34:33	Makere	just make the service run as your user account and that should solve whatever permission issues you have
2019-09-15 11:34:43	+Nelluk	hmm guess i need to look into how to do that
2019-09-15 11:35:00	+Nelluk	the way ive solved perm issues is adding the SERVICE account with full control to my download dirs
2019-09-15 11:35:11	Makere	open up services.msc right click the service properties, there should be the user acc used to run the service
2019-09-15 11:36:46	Makere	sure if you want to get even more fancy, you can make a seperate user account for sonarr
2019-09-15 11:37:35	+Nelluk	nice that seems to work well; thanks

2019-09-15 12:00:14	Ether_Man	Nelluk, well, for a service, it runs prior to login. App on startup doesn't run without an interactive desktop.  As for permissions, that's easily solved by just changing what user it runs as. You can set the service to run as your normal logged in user even in order to get access to network shares and such.

2019-09-15 12:55:59	keith	multi technically does that
2019-09-15 12:56:18	keith	there should be multiple language tracks, hence multi

2019-09-15 12:59:38	_Raijin	Can I manually blacklist them so they dont keep automatically downloading?

2019-09-15 12:59:43	keith	yes

2019-09-15 13:00:01	keith	when downloading or whatever
2019-09-15 13:00:14	keith	or just blacklist n3tfl1x entirely, which is what i would do
2019-09-15 13:00:20	keith	you could even blacklist 'multi' if you want
2019-09-15 13:04:41	_Raijin	Sorry, I'm not seeing the "blacklist slider". How would I go about blacklisting 'multi' or 'n3tfl1x'? The 'X' in the blacklist menu just removes it from the list
2019-09-15 13:08:47	keith	im on v3, so where stuff is for me is different than you

2019-09-15 13:09:09	keith	this is likely where its at

2019-09-15 13:09:39	Ether_Man	At the bottom iirc. And you need advanced active
2019-09-15 13:10:40	_Raijin	v3? How would I go about upgrading? I just use the linuxserver/sonarr docker image which I just updated
2019-09-15 13:11:44	_Raijin	Found the indexer restrictions, thanks
2019-09-15 13:12:14	keith	use :preview instead of :latest IIRC
2019-09-15 13:12:36	_Raijin	Nice. what are the biggest changes?
2019-09-15 13:13:15	keith	tons.
2019-09-15 13:13:23	keith	brand new ui, streamlined everything
2019-09-15 13:13:32	keith	v2 hasnt really been worked on for over a year
2019-09-15 13:14:05	_Raijin	Sounds rad. So it's not planning on being merged into the main image? like hydra has a v2 as a completely different image
2019-09-15 13:14:43	_Raijin	And I can simply switch to :preview and rebuild the container and all my configs and everything will be the smae?
2019-09-15 14:03:59	_Raijin	Ah, it looks a lot more like lidarr now!
2019-09-15 14:15:13	Deihmos	first time hearing about lidarr
2019-09-15 14:29:04	_Raijin	Basically a sonarr clone that tracks music! Not perfect, but a handy way of seeing what music you have and keep track of new releases. Also usenet is not great for music so i'm looking into torrents

2019-09-15 15:12:15	Ether_Man	Would even be useful if it wasn't so totally craptastic at foreign chars, or had some sort of alias system. As it is, it's almost impossible to find as an example, 浜崎あゆみ albums, because most of her stuff is released under either her romajisated(?) name Ayumi Hamasaki, or her stagename Ayu. But it also only finds a limited set of albums with the proper 浜崎あゆみ name because of the poor handling of the encoding :/
2019-09-15 15:15:35	Ether_Man	Last I looked at it, it found like 1 album out of 17, even though all were available. Even 'Weird' Al it had trouble with due to the 'Weird' part which becomes %27Weird%27%20Al, so url encoded, which is fine for trackers that support that... Less so for trackers that do not.

2019-09-15 15:20:55	_zoggy_	so yes you can just drop the french tracks if you wanted english only
2019-09-15 15:21:58	_zoggy_	but if you didnt want their releases just add that group to your ignore list
2019-09-15 15:23:40	Ether_Man	I downed a copy of it and it does only have a french audio track. E4 however has both. I'm thinking either someone has ripped out the eng track and spreading that with the original name, or someone forgot to add the eng track before releasing it in the first place :)

2019-09-15 15:29:31	_zoggy_	eww better source than the streaming services of the early 90s
2019-09-15 15:30:14	Ether_Man	Better quality yes. But it takes up so much space, and it's such a hassle to fiddle with >_<
2019-09-15 15:30:16	_Raijin	Ether_Man: Yes it does have issues recognizing certain things. For example itr retagged the chinese artist "Elephant Gym" as "大象體操". Also for some artists it just is out of date on their works, like Childish Gambino or Chance the Rapper. It's only as good as the music DB it points to
2019-09-15 15:30:30	_zoggy_	if you care about space, just stream?
2019-09-15 15:30:51	_zoggy_	or you know, buy a bigger hdd.. they are cheap
2019-09-15 15:31:48	_Raijin	Yeah not concerned about filesize rn, and it does find a good amound of what I'm looking for. I think the annoying gaps in my library mostly can be filled by getting better indexers somehow
2019-09-15 15:32:23	Ether_Man	_Raijin, Not true. It points to Musicbrainz, which is awesome. The reason it retagged Elephant Gym to 大象體操 is because that's their actual name. Elephant Gym is just a translation. Musicbrainz has all the names listed, which is why Lidarr knows it's that group. It just doesn't have any alias system, so it can only have one name, and that will ofc be the primary name, which is their real name.
2019-09-15 15:33:06	_zoggy_	https://slickdeals.net/f/13380097-friends-season-1-10-digital-hd-tv-show-4-99-each-or-50-for-complete-series-for-amazon-prime-members-via-amazon?src=frontpage
2019-09-15 15:34:19	_Raijin	Ether_Man: I totally realize that's their translated name. It just doesn't match the tags I have set. Doesn't affect anything outside Lidarr. I'm also familiar with Musicbrainz. One example of what I am getting at is Chance the Rapper. His only album listed is the new one, but he has released numerous mixtapes on soundcloud, spotify, etc
2019-09-15 15:36:02	Ether_Man	_Raijin, you can select what to include though. Just edit the artist, and change what types to include to include more than just Albums. https://musicbrainz.org/artist/373a4c98-a46b-48e4-86ec-f6ca65b4f438 and you can see what his albums are registered as
2019-09-15 15:38:55	_Raijin	Ether_Man this would be great, but I dont see any options for that under "Edit" in the artist menu. Just quality profile and folder path
2019-09-15 15:40:54	Ether_Man	Oh sorry, it's in the Metadata Profiles :)
2019-09-15 15:41:33	Ether_Man	You then edit the artist to use that profile
2019-09-15 15:43:51	_Raijin	Beautiful. Even more compelling reason to use it

2019-09-17 12:33:10	peterT	Ok, so if I set the Future monitoring, it just start monitoring all the episodes onwards, and then just download them as the days are going forward. Then if it is downloaded it will steel keep monitoring, right?

2019-09-17 12:33:56	M0UL	yes. but it also depends on the profile you use.
2019-09-17 12:34:28	peterT	You mean the video quality right?
2019-09-17 12:34:33	M0UL	yes
2019-09-17 12:34:37	peterT	It is setup OK I would say.
2019-09-17 12:35:02	peterT	I am curious if the next episode would disable the monitoring today.
2019-09-17 12:35:09	peterT	Sadly I do not see such information in logs.

2019-09-17 12:41:59	peterT	Or I need to use the option in settings

2019-09-17 12:45:39	Ether_Man	peterT, the monitoring set to Future, is only about what you add the series as. After adding, it's entirely controlled by the status of the parent so to speak. New seasons are monitored if the series is monitored, otherwise they're not. New eps are monitored if the season they're added to is monitored, otherwise they're not.
2019-09-17 12:46:37	Ether_Man	So if new eps are added, but sonarr never monitors them, then you have to set the season as monitored.
2019-09-17 12:47:04	peterT	Ether_Man I have the entire season monitoring as Future.
2019-09-17 12:47:22	Ether_Man	Once your show is added, there is no such thing.
2019-09-17 12:47:39	peterT	Problem is that once the airing date of the episode went by, the episode turned off itself from monitoring - never downloading
2019-09-17 12:49:16	peterT	right.. monitor episodes is future
2019-09-17 12:51:13	Ether_Man	Again, once show is added, there is no such thing. The future thing is JUST about what status things should have during the creation of the show entry when you add the series. As in, just the initial decisions. Once added, it's entirely controlled by the status of the parent what new eps get... But if it unmonitors eps by itself... Well that would be a bug, because there's no function in Sonarr that does that outside of the file being
2019-09-17 12:51:14	Ether_Man	deleted
2019-09-17 12:52:39	M0UL	that is how it works.
2019-09-17 12:52:54	peterT	I will see tomorrow. I have used season pass to monitor the future series, and series editor to turn on monitoring.
2019-09-17 12:53:18	peterT	The tomorrows episode is monitored currently - which is good. I will see the status tomorrow then.
2019-09-17 12:53:21	peterT	Thanks for the help
2019-09-17 12:53:49	Ether_Man	Right, season passing with Future, just resets the monitoring status to a preset just as if you just added the show. New eps are still decided on by the parent.
2019-09-17 12:54:55	Ether_Man	So if you run that right after an ep airs, that will unmonitor the ep, because you just asked it to only have eps in the future monitored, but that's you manually doing it.
2019-09-17 12:55:16	peterT	Yes, makes sense.
2019-09-17 12:55:23	peterT	Hope it stays then
2019-09-17 12:56:30	peterT	Can I use the quality definition title, to filter out my preffered release?
2019-09-17 12:56:46	peterT	such as only AMZN release, or only HDTV release, FGT release and so on.
