2019-09-08 14:59:08	BjrnLinseGitter[	Though YCM error is weird. I would be sure that coc implements JS using vscode/lsp code only, and not "shell out" to python code for it. Sure you haven't YCM installed yourself?

2019-09-08 16:01:01	HirokazuHataGitt	If you want use tabnine with coc, I think you should remove tabnine-vim and install coc-tabnine.

2019-09-08 16:05:52	_Raijin	OK, i'll give that a shot
2019-09-08 16:13:05	_Raijin	So I have the coc-tabnine extension downloaded and the tabnine-vim plugin uninstalled. Now it seems that the I can cycle through the options with Ctrl+n, and accept with Enter. However now pressing tab will insert a <Tab> instead of cycling, which is how I prefer it.
2019-09-08 16:14:26	_Raijin	^to clarify, it stopped working the way I prefer

2019-09-09 08:29:12	LeoNerd	Folks: OSC 52. Thoughts?
2019-09-09 08:29:23	LeoNerd	I.e. "interact with terminal clipboard directly using escape sequences"
2019-09-09 08:29:47	LeoNerd	Good thing, bad thing? I'm fed up of folks having to fiddle with X11 forwarding and Xlib and other such crap, just to get clipboard working; doubly so over ssh and other such fun
2019-09-09 08:30:00	LeoNerd	OSC 52 would avoid all of that mess
2019-09-09 08:45:34	BjrnLinseGitter[	LeoNerd: Neovim is certainly open to support it. But someone has to step up and do the work :)
2019-09-09 08:45:57	LeoNerd	Yeah.. hrm
2019-09-09 08:46:24	LeoNerd	That's always the fun part. I know *what* code to write just not where to write it
2019-09-09 08:46:52	LeoNerd	"finding the bits" is always the hard part for me. Well, that and spinning up a dev env. But at least in nvim's case I have one already
2019-09-09 08:46:53	LeoNerd	somewhere
2019-09-09 08:46:54	BjrnLinseGitter[	BTW pango 1.44 seems to break pangoterm along with many other monospace-grid based programs.
2019-09-09 08:47:08	LeoNerd	Oh wouldn't surprise me. I do _evil_ evil things to it
2019-09-09 08:47:57	BjrnLinseGitter[	mostly affecting arch users. for now... Downgrading to 1.43 works for now for me.
2019-09-09 08:48:20	BjrnLinseGitter[	also neovim-gtk and gnvim (also based on gtk) seems to be affected

2019-09-09 08:50:15	BjrnLinseGitter[	They seem to be aware they broke stuff. They claim that changing stuff in cairo for the next version might mitigate the problem.
2019-09-09 08:50:37	LeoNerd	Mm. OK.. probably just keep an eye on it then until resolution happens
2019-09-09 08:50:56	LeoNerd	Anyhow.. on OSC 52 - first progress would be support in libvterm/pangoterm, otherwise nvim would have nothing to talk to
2019-09-09 08:50:59	LeoNerd	So I need to fix that
2019-09-09 08:51:16	BjrnLinseGitter[	https://blogs.gnome.org/mclasen/2019/08/07/pango-1-44-wrap-up/ "subpixel rendering issues" they say, but those subpixels seems to quickly add up to incorrect offsets of many pixels.
2019-09-09 08:51:50	LeoNerd	While also working with Zwegner on this reflow stuff
2019-09-09 08:51:57	LeoNerd	Ugh.. so much to do :(
2019-09-09 08:53:11	BjrnLinseGitter[	The relevant part to start with OSC 52 in nvim is src/nvim/tui/tui.c . If someone implements the low-level stuff for reading/emitting the control sequence stuff, I could help to wire it up with the rest of nvim.
2019-09-09 08:53:57	JustinMKeyesGitt	OSC 52 is tracked by https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/3344
2019-09-09 08:55:05	JustinMKeyesGitt	I would guess `tui/input.c:handle_background_color()` and its related patches (git blame) would be the pattern to follow for handling OSC 52
2019-09-09 08:56:18	LeoNerd	Well, first I need to have something to actually test with ;)
2019-09-09 08:59:06	LeoNerd	and first I need to write myself a `tclip`; modeled on `xclip`

2019-09-09 09:11:15	BjrnLinseGitter[	yah, I had to try three different suggested magic incantations to make xterm use ESC for meta
2019-09-09 09:12:47	LeoNerd	Annoying that it has this list because Id on't think I can write an xresources config file that just removes a couple of items from it
2019-09-09 09:12:53	LeoNerd	So I'll have to ocntinue to list all the other values :(

2019-09-09 13:19:19	BjrnLinseGitter[	I mean, if the program inside `:terminal` uses the 255 or 16 palette, we can pass through these colors unmodified as indicies, even if the rest of nvim uses rgb colors.

2019-09-09 14:25:17	ShalokShalom	your CMakeList/Makefile looks for lua in /usr/bin/lua while its /usr/bin/lua5.1
2019-09-09 14:27:12	ShalokShalom	 /usr/bin/lua is our distributions standard lua5.2
2019-09-09 14:29:20	JustinMKeyesGitt	what change do you suggest?
2019-09-09 14:30:44	ShalokShalom	No, I do not suggest a change
2019-09-09 14:30:50	ShalokShalom	I ask for one solution
2019-09-09 14:31:05	ShalokShalom	How to change it locally
2019-09-09 14:33:33	JustinMKeyesGitt	this is handled by https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/cmake/FindLua.cmake , and typically you tell it where to find lua via `LUA_INCLUDE_DIR`
2019-09-09 14:34:06	ShalokShalom	oh, a build trigger?

2019-09-09 14:37:02	ShalokShalom	well, 5.2 and 5.1 are both in the same dir
2019-09-09 14:37:13	ShalokShalom	the issue is, that it assumes that lua = 51
2019-09-09 14:37:29	JustinMKeyesGitt	what is "it"?

2019-09-09 14:47:59	mcepl	we use system lua packages from openSUSE

2019-09-09 14:49:04	JustinMKeyesGitt	mcepl: for some reason i thought you were using lua 5.2, but i see lua51 in that spec
2019-09-09 14:49:05	ShalokShalom	thanks
2019-09-09 14:49:09	mcepl	yes, we build on 5.1 (preferably LuaJIT), but on Fedora we built with their system Lua (which is 5.3, I believe)
2019-09-09 14:49:15	ShalokShalom	thats such a mess
2019-09-09 14:49:50	mcepl	ShalokShalom: true for the multi-platform SPEC, but I think the system one is more or less reasonable.
2019-09-09 14:50:02	mcepl	(patches welcome!)
2019-09-09 14:50:11	JustinMKeyesGitt	it's a mess because distros are weird about Lua, and can't seem to fathom having multiple versions on the same system
2019-09-09 14:50:12	ShalokShalom	our distro uses 5.2
2019-09-09 14:50:18	mcepl	JustinMKeyesGitt: I had to be multi-Lua because of Fedora
2019-09-09 14:50:34	ShalokShalom	I just spend a bit to build all for 5.1, just to discover that it "should" work anyways
2019-09-09 14:50:47	mcepl	JustinMKeyesGitt: openSUSE is perfectly capable of havbing mutliple Luas on one system.
2019-09-09 14:50:49	ShalokShalom	why not write the CMake in such a way that all three are working
2019-09-09 14:50:57	mcepl	(everything is prefixed)
2019-09-09 14:51:10	ShalokShalom	that would make it much more accessible
2019-09-09 14:51:18	JustinMKeyesGitt	ShalokShalom: because Lua 5.1 is  a different language than Lua 5.2/5.3
2019-09-09 14:51:22	ShalokShalom	i know
2019-09-09 14:51:29	ShalokShalom	it seems you build all three anyways
2019-09-09 14:51:42	mcepl	ShalokShalom: Lua is (unfortunately) not like Python, Perl, or any other reasonable language in this regard.
2019-09-09 14:51:42	ShalokShalom	and other distros will do so as well
2019-09-09 14:51:58	ShalokShalom	Python is reasonable in this regard?
2019-09-09 14:52:17	mcepl	Yes, Python 3 is more or less compatible for 9 minor versions these days.
2019-09-09 14:52:32	mcepl	and there are pretty sucessful dual-Python programs.
2019-09-09 14:52:35	ShalokShalom	aha.. these days
2019-09-09 14:52:35	JustinMKeyesGitt	We will eventually side-step the issue by inlining whatever Lua modules we want, and avoiding distro's packages entirely.
2019-09-09 14:52:49	ShalokShalom	while it was a major break back then?
2019-09-09 14:52:58	mcepl	ShalokShalom: and it was always prefectly compatible for all Python 2:* versions.
2019-09-09 14:53:01	ShalokShalom	JustinMKeyesGitt that would be awesome
2019-09-09 14:53:03	JustinMKeyesGitt	Lua is an embedded language, and using a system packager for it is pointless
2019-09-09 14:53:26	ShalokShalom	that would be double awesome, since then I can put neovim easier into the community repos
2019-09-09 14:53:27	mcepl	JustinMKeyesGitt: that is not awesome ... we will have to unbundle these packages anyway (I will do it for lpeg certainly)

2019-09-10 10:47:01	mcepl	is it really a good idea to have 'updatetime' control BOTH writing swapping file to disk and hovering time?
2019-09-10 10:49:17	JustinMKeyesGitt	mcepl: plugins generally mis-use 'updatetime', or are you asking about LSP PR?
2019-09-10 10:50:05	mcepl	JustinMKeyesGitt: I don't think it is realted with LSP ... why these two completely different actions have the same delay?
2019-09-10 10:50:38	JustinMKeyesGitt	i'm still not clear on what "hover" you're referring to
2019-09-10 10:50:45	mcepl	I would love to have not that many writes for swap ... computers are more reliable these days, and a way shorter hover time.
2019-09-10 10:51:05	mcepl	LSP plugin just waits on CursorHold event, which is The RIght THing™, isn’t it?

2019-09-10 10:51:41	JustinMKeyesGitt	yes, and 'updatetime' should stay at its default.

2019-09-10 10:52:18	mcepl	4 seconds is awfully long time to wait for hover
2019-09-10 10:53:23	JustinMKeyesGitt	yes, timer would make more sense. Though I've long wanted something like an `autocmd Idle {timeout} ...` event (I think this is on Bram's old todo.txt also)
2019-09-10 10:54:41	JustinMKeyesGitt	but even then, "Idle" doesn't really match the semantics of a hover trigger
2019-09-10 10:54:56	mcepl	Well, and wouldn't it be better just to split updatetime into two opotions ... I don't want to fiddle with timeout for every autocommand I use.
2019-09-10 10:55:09	JustinMKeyesGitt	"Hover" is a different event, and mouse may move during Hover over a particular region
2019-09-10 10:55:21	mcepl	so updatetime would stay for swap writing, and hovertime would be the new one.
2019-09-10 10:55:46	BjrnLinseGitter[	"hovertime" sounds too specific

2019-09-11 04:29:04	ShalokShalom	hi there
2019-09-11 04:30:25	ShalokShalom	your trigger LUA_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/bin/ is supposed to switch the lua directory
2019-09-11 04:30:45	ShalokShalom	sadly, all my lua versions life in the same directory, so how to choose 5.1 specifically?
2019-09-11 04:32:03	BjrnLinseGitter[	something like `LUA_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/lua5.1/` ?
2019-09-11 04:32:24	ShalokShalom	its in usr/bin
2019-09-11 04:32:31	BjrnLinseGitter[	both lua.h cannot literally be in the same directory..
2019-09-11 04:32:33	ShalokShalom	no separate folder
2019-09-11 04:32:48	ShalokShalom	and how to choose which bin?
2019-09-11 04:33:13	BjrnLinseGitter[	libraries can be in the same folder, but LUA_INCLUDE_DIR sounds like the dir for .h files
2019-09-11 04:33:51	ShalokShalom	i dont know
2019-09-11 04:34:27	BjrnLinseGitter[	LUA_INCLUDE_DIR should literally be the dir where lua.h is present (looking at our `FindLua.cmake` )
2019-09-11 04:34:27	ShalokShalom	Neovim looks up in /usr/bin
2019-09-11 04:35:04	ShalokShalom	Some other person in this channel told me this is the right trigger to manipulate the binary
2019-09-11 04:35:20	BjrnLinseGitter[	in /usr/bin it would find a `lua` or `luajit` binary in order to run our lua build scripts, it is not the same thing

2019-09-11 04:35:52	ShalokShalom	This is exactly what I say
2019-09-11 04:36:05	BjrnLinseGitter[	we even specifically fixed our build scripts to work with at least lua 5.2, even if nvim binary itself is expected to link to lua 5.1
2019-09-11 04:36:37	ShalokShalom	So?
2019-09-11 04:36:38	ShalokShalom	When?
2019-09-11 04:36:42	ShalokShalom	Yesterday?
2019-09-11 04:37:10	BjrnLinseGitter[	but what is your lua 5.1 binary located? `/usr/bin/lua5.1` ?
2019-09-11 04:38:13	ShalokShalom	yes

2019-09-11 04:47:52	BjrnLinseGitter[	no problem :)
2019-09-11 04:48:11	BjrnLinseGitter[	did you base it on the existing AUR pkgbuild?
2019-09-11 04:48:25	BjrnLinseGitter[	etc/xdg/nvim/sysinit.vim is not something that has been changed recently
2019-09-11 04:49:02	ShalokShalom	yes, I did base it on the existing AUR pkgbuild
2019-09-11 04:49:19	ShalokShalom	Its just a totally different, independent distribution
2019-09-11 04:49:23	ShalokShalom	So I had to port it
2019-09-11 04:49:28	ShalokShalom	And I am very bad at it :D
2019-09-11 04:49:54	ShalokShalom	So it is supposed to work with 5.2 as well=
2019-09-11 04:50:09	ShalokShalom	Since that would need less packages in the user repository
2019-09-11 04:50:20	BjrnLinseGitter[	I don't have this etc/xdg/nvim/sysinit.vim file either, probably nothing to worry about
2019-09-11 04:50:22	ShalokShalom	I will build fvim in the end
2019-09-11 04:50:25	ShalokShalom	ok, fine
2019-09-11 04:50:28	ShalokShalom	thanks
2019-09-11 04:50:31	BjrnLinseGitter[	but if you already have luajit then use that
2019-09-11 04:50:43	ShalokShalom	sure
2019-09-11 04:50:52	ShalokShalom	luajit is not running on 5.2?
2019-09-11 04:51:13	ShalokShalom	hnn, ah you mean it dont run on 5.1 right now?
2019-09-11 04:51:17	mcepl	ShalokShalom: LuaJIT is an alternative interpreter compatible with 5.1
2019-09-11 04:51:18	BjrnLinseGitter[	5.1 + a few extensions from 5.2
2019-09-11 04:51:25	ShalokShalom	I see.
2019-09-11 04:51:36	ShalokShalom	So I dont need to build 5.2
2019-09-11 04:51:41	ShalokShalom	Just luajit?
2019-09-11 04:51:47	BjrnLinseGitter[	I think it is binary compatible with lua51-xxx binary packages
2019-09-11 04:51:51	ShalokShalom	Since that one is already in the userreps, that would be awesome
2019-09-11 04:51:55	BjrnLinseGitter[	yes.
2019-09-11 04:51:56	ShalokShalom	I see, cool ^-^
2019-09-11 04:52:00	ShalokShalom	Thats great
2019-09-11 04:53:17	BjrnLinseGitter[	just curious, what is this distribution?
2019-09-11 04:53:36	ShalokShalom	KaOS
2019-09-11 04:54:08	ShalokShalom	Here I link you the website, since there are multiple distros with this name: https://kaosx.us/

2019-09-11 04:59:31	ShalokShalom	do you know the Dirk Hohndel talk?
2019-09-11 04:59:49	ShalokShalom	the from gtk to qt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGZyVSOnqm0
2019-09-11 05:01:10	BjrnLinseGitter[	I've heard about it. But somehow gtk works better in practice.
2019-09-11 05:01:28	BjrnLinseGitter[	C rather than C++ seems nice when binding to other languages
2019-09-11 05:01:40	ShalokShalom	I see
2019-09-11 05:01:40	LeoNerd	+1
2019-09-11 05:01:53	ShalokShalom	QT has the burden that it gets badly integrated
2019-09-11 05:02:02	ShalokShalom	Most distros put it on top of a GTK stack
2019-09-11 05:02:09	ShalokShalom	That this cant work is obvious
2019-09-11 05:02:27	BjrnLinseGitter[	like compiling gnvim (using rust-gtk) takes less than a minute, but go-neovim took 40+ min just to build go-qt bindings.
2019-09-11 05:02:47	BjrnLinseGitter[	And I think that is more on qt than go....
2019-09-11 05:03:12	ShalokShalom	I guess thats more about this specific implementation

2019-09-11 05:04:12	BjrnLinseGitter[	well it needs to compile c++ code for every c++ function in qt, because Go does not have a c++ ffi, nor does most other languages.

2019-09-11 05:04:37	ShalokShalom	Ah, you use QtWidgets
2019-09-11 05:04:40	BjrnLinseGitter[	things like https://github.com/JuliaInterop/Cxx.jl is yet an exception, not the norm :)
2019-09-11 05:05:01	ShalokShalom	QML is JavaScript
2019-09-11 05:05:23	ShalokShalom	QtWidgets is not very much used these days
2019-09-11 05:05:42	BjrnLinseGitter[	well you need to ask gonvim about that.
2019-09-11 05:05:44	ShalokShalom	No hardware acceleration, no mobile support and the languages
2019-09-11 05:06:23	BjrnLinseGitter[	if you write an app in rust or go, maybe you don't want to write a lot of js in addition, unless you have choosen to go the Electron Way.
2019-09-11 05:06:37	ShalokShalom	The binding allows for both
2019-09-11 05:06:42	ShalokShalom	And its dev is super nice ^^
2019-09-11 05:08:51	ShalokShalom	Yeah, it is written in Widgets
2019-09-11 05:15:12	ShalokShalom	BjrnLinseGitter[ You dont need to write in JS
2019-09-11 05:15:26	ShalokShalom	I am just saying it is a completely different integration.
2019-09-11 05:21:04	ShalokShalom	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_language_bindings_for_Qt_5
2019-09-11 05:24:17	BjrnLinseGitter[	ShalokShalom: right but either way you need to write code in the target language or a FFI to the target language
2019-09-11 05:24:40	 - 	mkoskar_ is now known as mkoskar
2019-09-11 05:24:49	BjrnLinseGitter[	perhaps the QML API surface is smaller, but then it might miss some functionality of qtwidget that gonvim wants.
2019-09-11 05:25:05	ShalokShalom	It is declarative, in the first place
2019-09-11 05:25:25	ShalokShalom	Which also means more functional/shorter
2019-09-11 05:25:29	ShalokShalom	As functional code tends to be

2019-09-11 08:29:48	mcepl	<ShalokShalom> QT has the burden that it gets badly integrated
2019-09-11 08:29:48	mcepl	<ShalokShalom> Most distros put it on top of a GTK stack
2019-09-11 08:30:08	mcepl	ShalokShalom: that sounds very strange to me. Qt quite definitively is not on the top of Gtk.
2019-09-11 08:30:30	ShalokShalom	The GTK stack here is the base system, which is optimized for GTK

2019-09-11 08:30:56	mcepl	OK, this so much doesn't make sense, that I will rather let it be.
2019-09-11 08:31:37	ShalokShalom	OK, imagine thousands of packages build on top of thousands of packages, since this is what a distribution is
2019-09-11 08:31:53	ShalokShalom	GTK plus GNOME on top of the rest of the system
2019-09-11 08:31:59	ShalokShalom	You optimize that
2019-09-11 08:32:15	ShalokShalom	Then you remove Gnome, put KDE on top and... what?
2019-09-11 08:32:28	ShalokShalom	You have the base system already adjusted towards Gnome
2019-09-11 08:32:32	ShalokShalom	You cannot change that
2019-09-11 08:32:52	ShalokShalom	This is why every distribution focused on one Toolkit and desktop environment
2019-09-11 08:33:46	ShalokShalom	Instead of building 4, 5, 6 DEs half baked on one base, we build 1 DE, together with a always optimized stable basis. Hope this clears things up :)

2019-09-11 14:08:48	JamesMcCoyGitter	The cmake files should have been changed to check for a new enough libvterm.  This is going to bite a lot of people since things fail at build time instead of configure time (with a nice message)

2019-09-12 06:05:13	LeoNerd	That would just be async writing in general. `sshfs` is mostly invisible to nvim, because it's just part of the filesystem
2019-09-12 06:05:43	LeoNerd	I sometimes have wanted nvim to be able to async write though, because it'd be nice to at least keep control of the cursor and move around and read maybe other files while I wait for the super-slow sshfs-to-other-side-of-the-world to finish
2019-09-12 06:05:48	vejetaryenvampir	Yeah, I meant async writing.

2019-09-12 06:06:56	LeoNerd	Eh; that entirely defeats the point of sshfs though :)
2019-09-12 06:07:10	LeoNerd	Really, nvim just needs to be able to asynchronise writing to the filesystem
2019-09-12 06:07:17	vejetaryenvampir	Yeah, I know.
2019-09-12 06:07:21	BjrnLinseGitter[	it solves the problem of having it "async", I assumed that was the important part.
2019-09-12 06:07:24	LeoNerd	I forget if libuv is around; if so that should be trivial
2019-09-12 06:07:52	LeoNerd	If not then in practice it's threadpooling because any other option suckcs :(
2019-09-12 06:07:59	vejetaryenvampir	Is there any solution or not? I'm confused.
2019-09-12 06:08:35	BjrnLinseGitter[	sure, someone can implement `:&w file` with libuv (I think that is the async task syntax from the workers PR, like `:&grep` )
2019-09-12 06:08:41	LeoNerd	I don't fully get the question. There are definitely solutions - a program in general should be able to implement this just fine
2019-09-12 06:08:54	LeoNerd	I don't know offhand if nvim has already written the code to allow it, or if someone must first go write it
2019-09-12 06:09:19	BjrnLinseGitter[	`:w /tmp/somepath` and `jobstart("scp /tmp/somepath host:/the/real/path")` is the workaround that works now. Judge for yourself if you consider it a solution or not.
2019-09-12 06:09:33	LeoNerd	.oO( It's days like today when I want DNIX )
2019-09-12 06:10:03	BjrnLinseGitter[	(wrapped in a plugin of course,  I have one myself but using `silent !scp` because network is fast :)
2019-09-12 06:10:28	vejetaryenvampir	My network is not fast. :/
2019-09-12 06:11:04	LeoNerd	The point is the convenience of just being able to `nvim path/to/file` off the regular filesystem, with tab completion in your shell, then be able to `:w` from nvim
2019-09-12 06:11:09	LeoNerd	No having to think about remote paths
2019-09-12 06:11:28	BjrnLinseGitter[	sure, but such a plugin could just as well use `jobstart`, this was just what I happened to have
2019-09-12 06:11:41	LeoNerd	I could justabout accept having to spell it `:&w` but if I have to think about remote filenames or hosts or whatever, that's too much
2019-09-12 06:13:06	BjrnLinseGitter[	tough my usecase/plugin had to think about remote paths anyway, because the operation is really "save and send python file to remote host and source that file inside a :terminal already running ipython on the remote host"
2019-09-12 06:13:12	LeoNerd	Would adding it into core nvim be possible? By defualt spell it `:&w` but maybe an option to allow all writes to become async?
2019-09-12 06:13:12	BjrnLinseGitter[	it is layers of glue all the way down :)
2019-09-12 06:13:28	BjrnLinseGitter[	it is for sure possible
2019-09-12 06:13:39	LeoNerd	OK that's less of a question and more a feature-request
2019-09-12 06:13:44	BjrnLinseGitter[	someone just has to wrap the async libuv function and make the interface nice.
2019-09-12 06:14:41	LeoNerd	https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+async+write  -- I don't currently see an issue for it
2019-09-12 06:15:01	BjrnLinseGitter[	actually `FileWriteCmd` could perhaps do it already, using `:lua vim.loop` :)
2019-09-12 06:15:37	LeoNerd	I have no comment to make on how to implement it; just as long as I can `:&w` or maybe `:set asyncwrite | :w`
2019-09-12 06:16:21	BjrnLinseGitter[	feel free to make an issue
2019-09-12 06:16:25	*	LeoNerd already writing
2019-09-12 06:16:38	LeoNerd	I'm just doing that asynchronously while also chatting here  ;)
2019-09-12 06:17:12	BjrnLinseGitter[	literal concurrency :]
2019-09-12 06:17:37	*	LeoNerd <== who added futures and async/await to Perl, lets not forget ;)

I've tried setting the alias to the full path (/Users/username/nvim-osx64/nvim" and "./$HOME/nvim-osx64/bin/nvim" but neither work, I get "-bash: ./Users/myusername/nvim-osx64/bin/nvim: No such file or directory"

2019-09-12 14:13:04	JustinMKeyesGitt	blueyed: Would like to minimize the verbosity of the issue template, avoid presenting the user with a decision-tree or big list of instructions. I have auto-reply for those types of tickets, which makes them mostly painless.  And it's mildly useful to have tickets in our tracker linking to upstream tickets, so that the patch can be found easily.

2019-09-13 06:16:24	ChristianClasonG	I _think_ the issue is that after #9807, when a float is created (such as a completion item preview window), either the `CursorMoved` autocommand is triggered in the wrong buffer (the opening one) or the filetype plugin is listening for autocommands in the wrong (or all) windows. Any idea how I can check which of these is the case?

2019-09-13 06:26:25	BjrnLinseGitter[	`CursorMoved` should not be triggered if the float is not entered. I thought we checked against this already (so that you can close the float in CursorMoved).

2019-09-13 06:27:02	BjrnLinseGitter[	it could be a false positive bisect. I e that commit is "bad", but we fixed that one issue soon afterwards. So the master issue is something else.
2019-09-13 06:29:48	crose	When I read a man page from the shell (`$ man foo`) using Nvim as a man pager, how is the name of the Nvim buffer set? More specifically, how was the buffer name set (`man://foo(1)`) when this autocmd is fired: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/3855204f5860ff2a66133541ff7593f0c2606a75/runtime/plugin/man.vim#L14 And by who? `nvim(1)` or `man(1)`?
2019-09-13 06:29:51	ChristianClasonG	@bfredl I double-checked (this time...) by commenting out the line `apply_autocmds(EVENT_CURSORMOVED, NULL, NULL, false, curbuf);` in `window.c` on master, and the issue goes away.
2019-09-13 06:30:20	ChristianClasonG	(edited) ... curbuf);` in `window.c` on ... => ... curbuf);` that was added in `window.c` in this PR on ...
2019-09-13 06:32:01	crose	Nvm, it's not the relevant autocmd.
2019-09-13 06:32:04	BjrnLinseGitter[	@clason This just tells us the issue involves CursorMoved, which we already knew.
2019-09-13 06:34:18	ChristianClasonG	@bfredl Sorry, I misunderstood then. It looked to me like this line explicitly triggers CursorMoved in the buffer that opened the float.
2019-09-13 06:35:32	BjrnLinseGitter[	none of these should be triggered if `enter=false` in nvim_open_win() via the `trigger_enter_autocmds` condition.
2019-09-13 06:36:24	BjrnLinseGitter[	the issue might not be the creation actually, but by some API `nvim_win_xxx` that your plugin uses that incorrectly triggers these autocmds
2019-09-13 06:38:07	ChristianClasonG	Yes, that could be. I'm a bit confused since it looks like the CursorMoved is triggered in the original buffer and not in the float that is opened, but that might just mean I don't know enough. (Probably does.)

2019-09-13 06:40:01	BjrnLinseGitter[	@clason can you extract a simple test case that triggers the issue? Or just point directly at the relevant code in the plugin (i e create window/buffer, set options, etc).
2019-09-13 06:41:47	ChristianClasonG	Sure, it's here (not my plugin, though): https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp/blob/da078b1096944d149a0593dc8e49ae097d7b4ed3/autoload/lsp/ui/vim/output.vim#L116
2019-09-13 06:42:00	BjrnLinseGitter[	nice, that is pretty self contained. I will try it out later :)
2019-09-13 06:42:35	BjrnLinseGitter[	oh, actually it calls nvim_open_win with enter=v:true, is this intentional?
2019-09-13 06:44:00	> 	georgie (~textual@121.211.55.123) has joined #neovim
2019-09-13 06:44:09	ChristianClasonG	Yes, I just noticed that. I think that's needed for the way the float is filled with contents (open first, set buffer later) -- it should probably be the other way round, first fill buffer, then create float. There might be a reason for that involving support for `completion/resolve` later on, though.
2019-09-13 06:44:30	BjrnLinseGitter[	this should not be needed regardless of the order.
2019-09-13 06:44:47	BjrnLinseGitter[	I think this was just cargo-culted from the vsplit branch
2019-09-13 06:45:21	BjrnLinseGitter[	vsplit requires enter window and then go back (currently, we should add API for this too), float should not require this.
2019-09-13 06:45:29	ChristianClasonG	Possibly -- I'd rather have cargo-culted from https://github.com/ncm2/float-preview.nvim (which does not have that issue) ;)

2019-09-13 06:47:55	ChristianClasonG	Well, maybe that way is rather due to wishing to treat vim popup and neovim float with a tighter case distinction -- I'd have to ask.
2019-09-13 06:48:28	> 	cotko (~cotko@84-255-193-179.static.t-2.net) has joined #neovim
2019-09-13 06:51:42	ChristianClasonG	@bfredl sorry to be obtuse here, but just to make sure: autocommands firing on the _opening_ buffer, not the entered buffer, is the intended behavior? (Independent of the fact that `enter=true` should be avoided, which I agree is the case.)
2019-09-13 06:51:59	BjrnLinseGitter[	well, it does `if s:use_nvim_float | call nvim_open_win(...) | else | new | endif` basically. so I think whoever wrote this thought the float need to the enter the window just like the `new` command this.
2019-09-13 06:52:21	BjrnLinseGitter[	Possibly just changing `enter=v:false` might actually work. vim popups are not entered anyway.
2019-09-13 06:52:21	ChristianClasonG	Makes sense. Thanks for confirming!
2019-09-13 06:53:27	ChristianClasonG	No, I tried that; the whole output routine is written around the vim popup paradigm, it seems, with local case distinctions to use nvim win commands...
2019-09-13 06:54:28	BjrnLinseGitter[	"No, I tried that;" as in "it didn't work"?
2019-09-13 06:55:01	BjrnLinseGitter[	If you never enter a nvim float, it should match the "vim paradigm" exactly.
2019-09-13 06:55:01	ChristianClasonG	Yes, sorry, that's exactly what I meant.
2019-09-13 06:55:22	BjrnLinseGitter[	and how does it not work?
2019-09-13 06:57:01	ChristianClasonG	This is getting a bit far into vim-lsp internals, but the contents are set with a different function (https://github.com/prabirshrestha/vim-lsp/blob/da078b1096944d149a0593dc8e49ae097d7b4ed3/autoload/lsp/ui/vim/output.vim#L146) that just calls `setline`, and this errors out.
2019-09-13 06:57:01	ChristianClasonG	The whole output stack needs to be rewritten to avoid `enter`, it seems.
2019-09-13 06:57:39	BjrnLinseGitter[	no, it should just use the code already written for `s:use_vim_popup`
2019-09-13 06:57:55	BjrnLinseGitter[	which uses `setbufline` which doesn't assume the window was entered
2019-09-13 06:58:16	ChristianClasonG	Oh, I see what you mean -- I'll try that.
2019-09-13 06:58:46	BjrnLinseGitter[	though `win_execute` needs to be `nvim_buf_set_option` on the buffer
2019-09-13 06:59:26	BjrnLinseGitter[	maybe we should add `win_execute` for compat, even if 95% of its usages can be expressed through our API.
2019-09-13 07:00:33	BjrnLinseGitter[	or `setbufvar` I guess would work on both vim and nvim.

2019-09-13 10:58:28	ChristianClasonG	@bfredl Would there be any interest in adding a higher-level function, where one would only need to specify content, minwidth, maxwidth, minheight, maxheight and position, and neovim handles the rest (kinda like vim's `popup_create-arguments`)?

2019-09-15 18:38:02	JustinMKeyesGitt	it will take a few hours for the win binary to get updated

2019-09-15 18:39:10	ReinaldoMolinaGi	ohh...kk...Thanks!
2019-09-15 18:39:52	JustinMKeyesGitt	most likely will need to release 0.4.2 to fix the release automation for windows. There was  a change to appveyor config that seems to have caused it to ignore tags, so it probably won't build 0.4.0/0.4.1.
2019-09-15 18:42:16	ReinaldoMolinaGi	Congratulations on the release BTW!!!

2019-09-16 06:17:30	SpencerWilliamsG	Sure enough, the tarfile packaging on neovim doesn't have the weird `resize_buffer` issue.

2019-09-16 06:21:55	SpencerWilliamsG	looks like homebrew grabs prebuilt stuff from its own bintray repos if it can.

2019-09-16 08:30:50	hdb2	hello - I'm new to neovim. I'm reading the doc and FAQ, but I'm confused about plugins; do I need to install a plugin manager (like vim-plug or pathogen), or is there something built-in I should use?
2019-09-16 08:33:02	> 	coellobranco (~FoRcEr@61.151.27.77.dynamic.reverse-mundo-r.com) has joined #neovim
2019-09-16 08:34:09	JamesMcCoyGitter	hdb2: You don't _have_ to use a plugin manager, but many people find them useful.  Pathogen is not a plugin manager so much as a manager of the runtimepath option.  The pathogen author himself now suggests using Vim's builtin runtimepath management, see ":help packages"
2019-09-16 08:35:20	hdb2	JamesMcCoyGitter: cool, thank you!  if you were going to use a plugin manager, is vim-plug a good place to start?
2019-09-16 08:35:34	hdb2	and I'll check out :help packages too
2019-09-16 08:36:30	JamesMcCoyGitter	I just use pathogen, since I manage updating the plugins on my own, so I can't really comment on any specific plugin manager
2019-09-16 08:39:37	JamesMcCoyGitter	dein and vim-plug are the two I hear about the most.  minpac is another alternative

2019-09-16 13:43:15	BjrnLinseGitter[	yes, if you have luajit, then use it.
2019-09-16 13:43:21	BjrnLinseGitter[	it has "bit" builtin already
2019-09-16 13:44:17	UrmishShahGitter	How are `lua` and `luajit` different? How do I use one over the other when doing a `neovim` compile? This is what my CMAKE command looks like
2019-09-16 13:44:17	BjrnLinseGitter[	> Another issue with lua is it is a nightmare for people without admin privileges and who don't know what lua really is.
2019-09-16 13:44:18	UrmishShahGitter	```
2019-09-16 13:44:19	UrmishShahGitter	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_PREFIX=/u/urmish/usr/local -DLIBLUV_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/u/urmish/usr/local/usr/local/lib/lua/luv.so -DLIBLUV_INCLUDE_DIR=/u/urmish/usr/local/usr/local/lib/lua -DLIBVTERM_LIBRARY:FILEPATH=/u/urmish/usr/local/usr/local/lib/libvterm.la -DLIBVTERM_INCLUDE_DIR=/u/urmish/usr/local/usr/local/lib ..
2019-09-16 13:44:19	UrmishShahGitter	```
2019-09-16 13:44:38	BjrnLinseGitter[	then you can either use the official binaries, or the "bundled" bulid which sets up a luajit environment from scratch
2019-09-16 13:46:53	BjrnLinseGitter[	Hmm, I would expect our CMakeLists to already prefer `luajit` if both is present.
2019-09-16 13:48:49	UrmishShahGitter	It is not honoring that in my case (latest nvim git clone)
2019-09-16 13:53:16	BjrnLinseGitter[	right, it also needs `lpeg` and `mpack` lua packages available in luajit
2019-09-16 13:53:47	BjrnLinseGitter[	chances are if your distro has packages like `lua51-lpeg` and `lua51-mpack`, they will also work with luajit
2019-09-16 13:53:49	UrmishShahGitter	I installed `lpeg` and `mpack`. It is `bit` which was causing this issue.

2019-09-16 13:54:21	UrmishShahGitter	Are `lua` packages available for `luajit` too?
2019-09-16 13:54:33	UrmishShahGitter	How do I force `nvim` to use `luajit` over `lua`?
2019-09-16 13:54:52	BjrnLinseGitter[	yes, but they need to be compiled for lua5.1 (which luajit is ABI compatible with)
2019-09-16 13:55:57	BjrnLinseGitter[	it loops over all lua versions and checks if mpack,lpeg, and bit are available, so all has to be available with luajit, otherwise it will consider the next version etc
2019-09-16 13:57:02	UrmishShahGitter	how do you install a package for `luajit`
2019-09-16 13:57:04	UrmishShahGitter	?
2019-09-16 13:57:18	UrmishShahGitter	I use `luarocks`. But that installs packages for `lua`
2019-09-16 13:58:53	BjrnLinseGitter[	yes, we would need to use luarock installed for the luajit environment

2019-09-16 20:22:47	yrp	so something changed with 0.4.2 on windows with regards to ginit.vim and launch
2019-09-16 20:23:18	yrp	previously when i launched nvim-qt it would spawn with my ginit.vim applied, which in this case is just GuiTabline 0
2019-09-16 20:23:46	yrp	now when i launch nvim-qt it pops a window, then refreshes as ginit.vim is applied
2019-09-16 20:23:57	yrp	which is kinda distracting and annoying. is there a workaround for this?

2019-09-17 04:33:17	blueyed	LeoNerd: or do you have a repo with all branches on bazaar.leonerd.org?
2019-09-17 04:33:28	LeoNerd	Hmm. Unsure if LP does multiple branches. In any case this is a bit of a one-off special; usually I'd keep releases from mainline and do unstable dev on branches
2019-09-17 04:33:50	LeoNerd	bazaar.lou is the primary upstream
2019-09-17 04:34:01	blueyed	(not so important I guess, since I can add it as separate remote, but it certainly makes the bzr experience more unpleasant ;))
2019-09-17 04:34:15	LeoNerd	It just lives behind my home VDSL line, so I prefer to point external folks at LP for official releases and so on
2019-09-17 04:34:39	LeoNerd	Though at this point most folks should be using the release tarballs anyhow
2019-09-17 04:35:06	blueyed	..which are still hosted on your vdsl then, no?
2019-09-17 04:35:38	LeoNerd	Nope - they're on LP or www.lou which lives on my digitalocean VM
2019-09-17 04:36:28	LeoNerd	www.lou is a mirror of home.lou which _does_ live at home. :)

2019-09-17 13:24:13	BjrnLinseGitter[	PotatoRick: see :help lua-stdlib . The most noteworthy feature merged for 0.4 is lua-loop (just below)

2019-09-17 13:26:46	chrizGitter[m]	I just tried it again, and it works

2019-09-17 13:27:55	chrizGitter[m]	thanks, @bfredl I guess I just need to add this path (.squashfs/...) so it can pick up the correct version?
2019-09-17 13:31:48	BjrnLinseGitter[	just `./squashfs-root/AppRun` should work to run it. Not sure the best way how to add it to PATH..

2019-09-18 10:51:37	blueyed	My use case is call signatures (jedi-vim).  Not sure how useful, but I've thought it might be nice if they could be placed/kept above/below (or behind!) the cursor position.
2019-09-18 10:52:33	blueyed	above/below has the drawback of covering the text around (therefore I've switched to preferring below, since you more likely want to look at code above), but having it right next to the cursor (at least when at EOL) would be nice I think.
2019-09-18 10:53:44	blueyed	LeoNerd: maybe you know already why "^M" might be turned into "^M^[[K" with Neovim jobs? (related to clr_eol/el ?)  (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/11056)
2019-09-18 10:54:03	LeoNerd	CSI K  is EL, Erase in Line
2019-09-18 10:54:35	LeoNerd	I have no idea what "turns into" means in this context

2019-09-18 11:01:59	BjrnLinseGitter[	blueyed: though I would think one would prefer to have the signature anchored to the start of the function call, instead of moving with every insert.
2019-09-18 11:02:39	BjrnLinseGitter[	like jedi does by itself (using the old conceal hack)

2019-09-18 11:03:46	blueyed	yes, that's how it's done currently (I have a WIP using a floatwin instead).. but it might a) cover the line just above then, where you often want to look at for reference, and b) does not work too well when near the EOL (not enough room then).
2019-09-18 11:04:24	blueyed	If you're interested in using that approach in jedi-vim (in case you do Python), I'm happy to push the WIP already.
2019-09-18 11:04:41	BjrnLinseGitter[	both of those are equally as much problems if the float moves with the cursor..

2019-09-18 11:05:31	blueyed	yeah.. in that case it could also move left to the cursor then.. above/below currently also get switched when not enough room.
2019-09-18 11:05:52	blueyed	but of course it is also bad to cover text left of the cursor often.. ;)
2019-09-18 11:06:23	blueyed	Currently I am replacing used args (before the current one) with ellipsis already, which appears to be nice for shortening.
2019-09-18 11:06:48	BjrnLinseGitter[	I just think the float is more distracting if it moves around with every insert/cursor movement, rather than find a good position to start with and stay there.

2019-09-18 11:12:00	blueyed	Yes, it should/would be configurable I guess.  I'd like to try having the annotation for the current and next args next to the cursor, but without having to update the position manually via CursorMovedI (but maybe better to prototype it via this method first, yeah)
2019-09-18 11:21:12	blueyed	LeoNerd: it seems like Git only outputs "\rfoo", but Neovim gets "\r\e[K" then
2019-09-18 11:21:44	LeoNerd	blueyed: I'm not following in the slightest. Context..? start again maybe?

2019-09-18 11:25:14	blueyed	LeoNerd: does not look like it - I've checked Git's source, and they are also not there when piping into "cat -A".
2019-09-18 11:25:34	blueyed	I've thought it might be related to some termios setting.
2019-09-18 11:25:36	LeoNerd	does jobstart give a pair of pipes, or a tty?
