Can I somehow find out if the reason is some new company policy enforced by firewall, e.g., is there some port or something which can be blocked in order to disable TLS?

2019-02-12 21:47:42	botho	how safe/efficient is a 'modprobe -r uvcvideo' compared to covering the webcam up? (privacy-wise)
2019-02-12 21:48:27	grawity	depends
2019-02-12 21:48:48	grawity	what attacker are you guarding against? someone with local code execution? someone with root privileges?
2019-02-12 21:49:42	grawity	drivers are autoloaded, so if anything happens to trigger a full USB rescan, you might just find uvcvideo loaded again
2019-02-12 21:50:00	grawity	if the attacker has root, or even just passwordless sudo, they can reinsert the module
2019-02-12 21:50:21	botho	that makes sense. thank you grawity 
2019-02-12 21:51:42	grawity	if you're trying to protect against programs which don't have special privileges, it works, but then the green LED on your webcam makes it not much of a risk anyway
2019-02-12 21:51:55	grawity	much easier to sneakily use the mic than the webcam
2019-02-12 21:53:09	grawity	(also, even without uvcvideo, someone sufficiently determined could just use raw libusb to control it in userspace)
2019-02-12 21:53:42	grawity	if you really want to control it through the OS, better try powering off the actual USB port via `uhubctl`, and making it an udev rule

2019-02-13 05:19:06	ameeno	the reason for this is my Root partition is space limited (20gb root partition) and my home partition is on a Hdd with much more space.

2019-02-13 05:24:01	ameeno	is there a way to do that
2019-02-13 05:24:02	ameeno	?

2019-02-13 05:28:29	SysGhost	ameeno: if some of those development stuffs don't themselves need the SSD speed, you could manage them separately outside the package database, and have em stored where you want. I do use a whole log of android and lineageos stuff that takes *lots* of space. But I manage them outside everything else in userland stored on a separate hard disk.

2019-02-13 05:32:12	grawity	it might take a while to set up on an existing partition (be sure to have backups), but I think it's the only sane option here
2019-02-13 05:32:15	ameeno	yes but how does it compare
2019-02-13 05:32:39	ameeno	to full ssd install? and is it robust?
2019-02-13 05:33:12	SysGhost	eventually you'll get the same speed as a direct install on the SSD, but it takes a while before it *knows* what to cache.
2019-02-13 05:33:13	rcf	ameeno: won't be as good as pure SSD, but you can't have full SSD. As for robustness, there have been issues, but you should be doing regular backups anyway.

2019-02-13 05:35:28	ameeno	so let me get this correct, Option 1) seperate the partitions (But moving /usr will kill speed) Option 2) move the largest offending apps manually using fstab binds, option 3) set up bcache devices for hdd/ssd and reinstall
2019-02-13 05:35:47	grawity	basically yes

2019-02-13 05:38:00	SneakySnake	Namarrgon: Well, as far as I can tell, --cat-config just lists input config files. It doesn't try to check for errors or anything. Anyway, the error happens when I have the geoclue package installed, I guess I can post that. `u geoclue - "Geoinformation service" /var/lib/geoclue`. Doesn't seem broken. I think the problem is that it tries to create that user, because it's not created yet, but it fails for some reason.

2019-02-13 05:50:23	rcf	ameeno: it looks like BCM4352 is supported by the kernel's b43 driver, if you want to try avoiding the broadcom driver. 
2019-02-13 05:50:27	grawity	afaik, Xen mainly does paravirt which requires special OS support, while KVM does full hardware virtualization... though that got added to Xen later on anyway
2019-02-13 05:50:34	grawity	and the paravirt patches got upstreamed eventually, too
2019-02-13 05:50:54	fernie	that naming is a bit confusing, bcache and bcachefs "You could think of it as bcache version two" and yet it does not do the thing bcache essentially does

2019-02-13 06:21:43	ilmostro	th0rne: might be a good question to ask in #archlinux-arm, btw
2019-02-13 06:22:34	th0rne	Well if it's anything like this channel, they'll ask if I'm using arch arm or manjaro and I'll tell them I'm running arch x64 and they'll tell me to get out.
2019-02-13 06:23:01	ayekat	I don't think so
2019-02-13 06:23:10	th0rne	Ok :)
2019-02-13 06:23:23	ayekat	you're asking an Arch ARM specific question to them - I'd be surprised if they showed you out
2019-02-13 06:23:30	th0rne	Fair point.

2019-02-13 10:01:53	johnnyfive	I've already tried posting this on the forums but not luck, so i'm going to try here again. I've setup GPU/PCI passthrough to a VM via OVMF. I am forwarding my keyboard/mouse via evdev. My issue is that everytime I click in the VM, my mouse teleports to the top left of the screen. Anyone have an idea why this is occurring?

2019-02-13 10:06:16	switchnode	i got the interface of the usb/ethernet adapter from dmesg, and i tried starting a netctl profile on it with "IP=no", bringing the interface up with `ip link set`, and dropping the adapter and bringing up my normal ethernet interface, but the relevant software still can't find the device. any ideas?

2019-02-13 11:23:30	@phrik	The double yy in `pacman -Syyu` is almost never needed. If you're switching to a mirror that uses an older copy of the repos, see !Syyuu instead. Unless your repo databases are completely corrupted, force-downloading already-up-to-date ones accomplishes nothing other than to waste bandwidth and server load. Do your part in conserving the internet, and avoid Syyu!

2019-02-13 11:23:37	@phrik	If you switch to a pacman mirror using an older database, *don't worry*. Just -Syu like normal and you will only ever get clean updates (or 404 file not found errors which are harmless if annoying; just wait a day or two and they'll go away). If you're switching to an older mirror and wish to downgrade, see !ala and use -Syyuu (the double uu ensures the actual downgrade part).

2019-02-13 11:25:51	gobostone	trying to debug some cpu stuff. I have a new thinkpad and the fan is super annoying. it never runs on battery because the cpu governor drops clock speed when not utilized and so it's almost always running at 800mhz and thus not hot. on AC however the cpuspeed never drops below the 3.4Ghz turbo max and so the fan very often kicks on. I'm using TLP to set the performance/clock speeds and nothing I set

2019-02-13 12:51:40	fiddlinmacx	I searched the forum and looked at archlinux.org, but I couldn't find this. Does anyone know why the electron package isn't updated to 4.x yet? I don't want to flag it out of date because I have a feeling there's a reason.

2019-02-13 18:04:51	novum	looking at polybar {whatever} --stdout  shows it does only update usually once every 2 seconds, sometimes a little more because of collisions of intervals. still just wondering/exploring

My objective is to have two vms (one with debian and one with arhc) running on the same host through qemu and kvm, and from that host ssh into them. I don't know where to start

2019-02-14 02:40:35	ahub	Hey there. I know redshift and f.lux are able to modify your color profile on the go. I'd like to do the same but to turn the color profile into full grayscale mode. Is it possible to do so ? 
2019-02-14 02:41:03	MrElendig	ahub: just set the colour depth in xorg to greyscale? :p
2019-02-14 02:41:38	MonRa	MrElendig: How do I chose? There seem to be multiple ways of achievin that like port forwarding, nat, using virtio devices, directly the host ip

Since in this configuration, kodi is started as fullscreen on a i3wm workspace, it somewhat interferes with my workflow. Is there any way to start only kodi, separately, on the second display, so that it doesn't run inside the i3wm but rather standalone.

I installed Arch on my laptop without a swap partition due to the amoutn of RAM I have and the fact that the HD is a SSD. I now am seeing that hibernation/sleep uses swap. If I want to add swap now, do I boot from arch live, resize root using cfdisk or something, create swap, then generate fstab again?
2019-02-14 05:38:12	qerecimen	also, should i use the UUID of the cryptlvm or the device?

2019-02-14 13:24:28	hazaardinari	MrElendig, isos are amnesic right? if i dont make a virtual hard disk file and make any changes to the iso, the changes dont show up after a reboot?
2019-02-14 13:24:29	grazzolini	hazaardinari: you'd use tails in that case right?

2019-02-14 13:25:29	grazzolini	hazaardinari: do it on your machine
2019-02-14 13:25:33	linux_dream	what the freaking sheet am i seeing in the aur?  petsc is required by slepc and other packages that dolfin-git needs.  but dolfin-git needs petsc-git   so in the end I must absolutely install both petsc and petsc-git to get dolfin-git working?  is this normal???
2019-02-14 13:26:01	urxtwin	where can I learn more about the difference between pacman and apt-get or yum, as in what can one do that the other cannot

2019-02-14 20:29:47	NeoHamled	I recently ran into an issue that I think I caused by a partial upgrade of libidn2. Most of the search results I found are from last month about a soname bump from libidn2.so.0 to libidn2.so.4 and failing to upgrade other packages against it. My problem is kind of the opposite though? My version of libidn2 does not provide libidn2.so.4 (pacman -Qo /usr/lib/libidn2.so.4 says nothing owns it), but my version of pacman is
2019-02-14 20:29:47	NeoHamled	still built against it. I had to download libidn2-2.1.0-1-x86_64.tar.xz from the arch linux archive and get the file from there before pacman would run again.

2019-02-14 20:30:01	NeoHamled	How can I figure out what has gone wrong and fix it?
2019-02-14 20:30:25	@sheep	what most likely happened is you ran pacman -Sy at some point then installed a package without doing -S(y)u
2019-02-14 20:30:33	@sheep	you can check /var/log/pacman.log to see what happened
2019-02-14 20:30:42	NeoHamled	okay
2019-02-14 20:30:43	elibrokeit	Also pacman does not need libidn2 at all
2019-02-14 20:30:48	elibrokeit	It does need curl though
2019-02-14 20:30:57	elibrokeit	And curl needs libidn2
2019-02-14 20:31:05	NeoHamled	elibrokeit: I mean... it doesn't directly but it crashed failing to find that for every command I tried
2019-02-14 20:31:16	elibrokeit	I just said that
2019-02-14 20:31:24	NeoHamled	good point
2019-02-14 20:31:34	elibrokeit	My point is that what is broken is your curl package, not pacman itself
2019-02-14 20:31:42	NeoHamled	thank you
2019-02-14 20:32:18	elibrokeit	Of course there may be many other partially updated packages as well, who knows

2019-02-14 20:36:41	NeoHamled	hmmm, okay I think perhaps my confusion is stemming from tripping myself up after doing -Syu and it still seemed like curl (through pacman) required libidn2.so.4, but that is not the case
2019-02-14 20:37:18	elibrokeit	What is not the case -- does pacman work?
2019-02-14 20:37:47	NeoHamled	it does now, I thought I had tried it at one point after upgrading everything and saw it still crashed with that issue, but I think I was mistaken
2019-02-14 20:38:00	elibrokeit	Okay, neat
2019-02-14 20:38:02	elibrokeit	!next
2019-02-14 20:38:03	NeoHamled	just so that I'm clear, most of the time this scenario can be fixed (or prevented) by just having done a proper sysupgrade

2019-02-14 20:39:05	elibrokeit	NeoHamled: correct. Not only that, in the specific case of libidn2 whose developer recently went mad with power, curl and others now use versioned dependencies
2019-02-14 20:39:31	@sheep	the weird soname bump?
2019-02-14 20:39:34	elibrokeit	.so.0 updated to .so.4, then downgraded to .so.0.3
2019-02-14 20:39:39	@sheep	why
2019-02-14 20:39:40	NeoHamled	right because most things with arch are just tracking latest from upstream right

2019-02-14 20:43:22	NeoHamled	so I'm guessing soname version numbers adhere to a stricter versioning requirement than semver
2019-02-14 20:43:44	@sheep	you increase it if and only if you break binary compatibility
2019-02-14 20:43:59	@sheep	and never decrease it under any circumstances
2019-02-14 20:44:03	elibrokeit	So name versions are basically server except it's the server of the binary compatibility
2019-02-14 20:44:14	@sheep	(unless you never released the increased version)
2019-02-14 20:44:25	elibrokeit	Regular semver is for user-facing stuff usually
2019-02-14 20:45:03	elibrokeit	As I said, the libidn2 developer went mad
2019-02-14 20:45:13	NeoHamled	is there a difference between bumping 0.3.4 to 0.3.5 and 0.3.4 to like 1.0.0
2019-02-14 20:45:27	NeoHamled	or is any change indicative of an abi break
2019-02-14 20:45:52	elibrokeit	Usually 1.0 means it is no longer compatible at all with 0.x
2019-02-14 20:46:04	NeoHamled	so probably an api change as well
2019-02-14 20:46:05	NeoHamled	okay
2019-02-14 20:46:14	NeoHamled	thanks again to you both
2019-02-14 20:46:30	elibrokeit	Whereas 0.3.4 to 0.3.5 indicates it added new functionality but packages built with the old version will still work

2019-02-14 20:47:57	elibrokeit	API changes tend to guarantee about changes as well, true

2019-06-08 11:40:31	bluecherry	Hi ! Today I updated my kernel from 4.20.12.arch1-1 to 5.1.7.arch1-1, and experienced random freezes (with or without starting a graphic server, and the only way out is a hard reboot) usually after 3 or 4 minutes of use. I realized blocking processor cstates>=1 in kernel params prevents the freezes, but it drains the battery and is not a viable option, so for the time being i simply downgraded my kernel. 
2019-06-08 11:40:31	bluecherry	After some googling, it seems a similar problem is well known for Baytrail processors and older kernels, but afaict my processor architecture is Kaby Lake. Is this a well-known thing, is there a way to fix it as of now ? Thanks for any kind of help.

2019-07-29 16:40:42	rcf	earnestly: I quickly figured this out while trying to write a converter from scratch in C. I then realized that I was reading Fontforge's documentation for the formats, so I should try fontforge itself....
2019-07-29 16:40:54	krux02	earnestly: ~/.local/share/fonts ?
2019-07-29 16:40:57	earnestly	krux02: pango-view -t hello --font Terminus
2019-07-29 16:40:59	earnestly	krux02: Yes
2019-07-29 16:41:35	earnestly	rcf: behdad is full of "just", his python scripts use the struct module
2019-07-29 16:41:42	earnestly	"just" do this, "just" do that
2019-07-29 16:41:48	earnestly	"just convert"
2019-07-29 16:42:08	krux02	earnestly, pange-view seems to work now
2019-07-29 16:42:16	earnestly	tada

2019-07-29 16:48:25	krux02	I honestly instally manjaro because I wanted an easy install Arch. But nope Manjaro is Manjaro.

2019-09-22 20:00:51	jamespharvey20	_Raijin: you need to reboot.  kernel is only loaded at boot, when you upgrade, it's still running the old kernel but deleted headers and modules for it.

2019-09-22 20:01:08	jamespharvey20	_Raijin: you don't _have_ to reboot after upgrading linux, but your headers and modules won't match if you need them
2019-09-22 20:01:50	genr8_	is anything being done about loading new kernels without rebooting ?
2019-09-22 20:02:19	jamespharvey20	genr8_: no, it's complicated enough no one wants to do it for the small benefit
2019-09-22 20:02:50	_Raijin	While i'm here, if anyone happens to be using i3: I have an error while using three monitors. If I reboot my computer, the right most monitor loads into i3, and can launch programs, but the screen is black. I can see the mouse cursor, the monitor is on. Screenshots actually show it as it should look. But it is black and doesn't show launched programs
2019-09-22 20:03:28	_Raijin	The only fix is to reboot into i3 WITHOUT a config file, and move your old config in and refresh.
2019-09-22 20:03:59	_Raijin	This doesn't happen with openbox or any other DE, yet the i3 devs closed my issue and insisted it "wasn't an i3 bug"
