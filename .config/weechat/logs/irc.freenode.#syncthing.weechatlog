2019-08-21 11:30:48	_Raijin	Hey, I am trying to setup a synchronized folder across my LAN. I want to keep my media server up to date with the Music on my main PC. On my main PC, I have syncthing running with my Music folder added and scanned. On my media server, I have syncthing running in a docker container. The desired folder is present here already, so I do not want to *transfer* it from my main PC. I also set it up so my server
2019-08-21 11:30:48	_Raijin	would ignore deletions (in case something happened to my PC). My issue is this: How do I sync the folders without copying all the files over? Also the two clients are constantly in the "Disconnected" state after a few mins after adding it. Various messages like "connection refused", not sure why they won't talk to each other

2019-08-21 14:34:09	_Raijin	_aD Yes I have a backup on an external HDD. Both systems have all the music
2019-08-21 14:42:38	_aD	Great. What'll happen is that on both devices, Syncthing will need to read and hash all of the data on the first run, which will be time-consuming.
2019-08-21 14:42:56	_aD	They'll then need to exchange indexes between each other, during which time the GUI will say they're Syncing but it won't seem like much is going on.
2019-08-21 14:43:11	_aD	For both of these stages you may need to be patient and let Syncthing do its thing
2019-08-21 14:43:32	_aD	Once that's been done, any changes will be exchanged (deletions excluded, where set) and that'll be that.
2019-08-21 14:43:38	_aD	Ref: the Disconnections, is that still a problem?

2019-08-21 15:11:55	_Raijin	_aD I'm resyncing on the server, connections look good so far. When I share the folder, will my main system recognize the server already has the data and not try to send it?
2019-08-21 15:12:48	_aD	As I mentioned above, as long as all of the data is present on both sides, no.

2019-08-21 16:36:36	_Raijin	_aD So I am still experiencing disconnecting issues. Also, When I try to share the folder which exists on both machines, it does indeed add a duplicate and unnecessary folder entry
2019-08-21 16:37:50	_aD	What do you mean by a "folder entry"?
2019-08-21 16:39:16	_Raijin	A new folder in the left half of the screen with the exact same name pops up.
2019-08-21 16:39:41	_aD	Aha, so there are two ways to add a folder in the GUI.
2019-08-21 16:39:54	_aD	When you click "Add Folder", it generates a new, random folder ID.
2019-08-21 16:40:19	_aD	Unless you edit that folder ID to match the one on the other side, you've then got two separate shared folders.
2019-08-21 16:40:39	_aD	If you accept the "Would you like to share folder X?" prompt, then it uses the same folder ID for you.
2019-08-21 16:41:13	_aD	Have you perhaps performed the former, and ended up with two different folder IDs?
2019-08-21 16:43:06	_Raijin	Not sure. Do the folders both needed to be added through syncthing before sharing? I tried to remove an unshared folder at one point and it just deleted the entire folder from my drive. 
2019-08-21 16:43:31	_aD	...you removed a folder using the GUI and it deleted your actual data?
2019-08-21 16:43:42	_Raijin	Yes

2019-08-21 16:44:30	_aD	That should never happen. What version of Syncthing are you using?
2019-08-21 16:45:07	_Raijin	v1.2.1
2019-08-21 16:45:41	_aD	Just tried a test here and the folder was left behind. What you saw is could be very troubling indeed.
2019-08-21 16:46:08	_aD	I've been using Syncthing for ages, and removed folders of many configurations and have never seen that happen.
2019-08-21 16:46:52	_Raijin	I have all the data now. I have both folders added and scanned into syncthing, with different folder IDs. Can I link them or do I have to delete the folder entry on the server side so one can be automatically created when I share from the PC?
2019-08-21 16:47:12	_aD	OK so yes, the folder IDs must be identical.
2019-08-21 16:47:52	_aD	It can't be changed via the GUI and I'm not keen on suggestion you mess about with the config file. I suggest that from the Syncthing GUI you remove one of the folders.
2019-08-21 16:48:39	_aD	Syncthing should show a banner at the top of the GUI to show you that a remote device wants to share a folder.

2019-08-21 16:49:09	_aD	Make sure that on Device A, the folder is configured to be shared with Device B.
2019-08-21 16:49:14	_Raijin	Just did that, and attempting to reshare now. Whenever I try to interact with the other device, I get the following disconnection errors:  context deadline exceeded (16:47:44)  connection refused (16:48:44)
2019-08-21 16:49:31	_aD	OK so that is a different problem I suspect.
2019-08-21 16:49:57	_aD	I believe that when pausing/creating folder shares, Syncthing disconnects from its peers. But I don't think it should then refuse connections.

2019-09-20 10:32:53	_Raijin	Hello, I am wondering If I have misconfigured something because syncthing is acting extremely slow. Basically I have a home PC and a media server, which both can download music. Any music downloaded on one gets synced to the other. Now I have about 7GB of music trying to sync from my server to my home PC, across my LAN. I left it going overnight and it doesnt even look CLOSE to being done
2019-09-20 10:34:16	_Raijin	Clicking the "Download rate" button changed the speed from 1.5KiB/Sec to about 1Mb/Sec. A bit confused. At this rate the transfer would still take ages

2019-09-21 08:06:12	wCPO	Is it expected that ST tries to set up inotify for/scan ignored folders?
2019-09-21 08:06:41	+canton7	I think so - there are some threads on the forum about this with more details
2019-09-21 08:09:45	 <<< 	fakuivan (~fakuivan@gateway/tor-sasl/fakuivan) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2019-09-21 08:09:46	wCPO	Thanks. It is a bit annoying as some of my ignored folders contain a lot of files and therefor sometimes break inotify.
