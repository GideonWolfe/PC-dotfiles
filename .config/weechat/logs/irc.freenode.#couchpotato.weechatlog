2019-09-20 21:56:25	_Raijin	Can someone give me advice? Compared to sonarr, couchpotato has a really hard time finding content (0-3 choices per movie) and even when I try to snatch it, it rarely makes it to my SABnzbd queue. Even if it does snatch correctly, they have a really hard time unpacking. They never seem to make it into jellyfin, unlike the TV shows which work pretty consistantly.
